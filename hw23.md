### 1. What is generic in Java? and type the generic code by yourself.

a. https://github.com/TAIsRich/chuwa-eij-tutorial/tree/main/02-java-core /src/main/java/com/chuwa/tutorial/t01_basic/generic

### 2. Read those codes and type it one by one by yourself. the push the code to your branch.
https://github.com/TAIsRich/chuwa-eij-tutorial/tree/main/02-java-core/src/mai n/java/com/chuwa/tutorial/t06_java8

### 3. Done
### 4. Write the Singleton design pattern include eager load and lazy load.
eager
```
 public class Singleton{
  private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
  private Singleton(){
  }
  
  public static Singleton getInstance(){
    return instance;
  }
 }
```
lazy
```
public class Singleton{
  private tatic volatile Singleton instance;
  private Singleton(){
  }
  public static Singleton getInstance(){
    if(instancfe == null){
      synchronized(Singleton.class){
        if(instance == null){
          instance = new Singleton();
        }
      
      }
    }
    return instane;
  }
}
```

###5. What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?

exception throwed in the runtime, program already starts running, some common examples 
are indexOutOfBoundException and NullPointerException: when access the 11th element in array
when array size = 10, or deference null eg String s = null, return s.size();

###6. example of npe:

String s = null;
System.out.println(s.size());

###7. Optional class 

Optional class helped with check and handle nullpointerexceptions

###8.@FunctionalInterface

FunctionalInterface is an annotater helps to check the interface only have 1 abstract class.

###9.lamda:
lamda helps reduce amount of code by using -> to simply define input and return value of a method 

###10. Method reference: 

refer method of functional interface, is a compact version of lamda expressionl. 

###11. Java8 new feature
lamda expression, functional interface, default method, Stream 

###12.lambda use unchanged variable: 
  a). final var
  b). var but never changed
  c). obj var unchanged(no new instance, setter is ok)
