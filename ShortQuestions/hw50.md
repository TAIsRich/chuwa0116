## 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md

## 2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
- Spring Cloud
- Zuul API Gateway (balancing loads of the micro-services)
- Eureka (Service Registry Center)
- Ribbon Load Balancer -> balancing loads of the providers
- Hystrix Circuit Breaker
- Config Server
- Kafka (Event based asynchronous communication between two services)
- Docker (Deployment of services)

## 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

- Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. Common resiliency patterns used in application development include the bulkhead pattern and circuit breaker pattern.

- The circuit breaker allows microservices to communicate as usual and monitor the number of failures occurring within the defined time period. If the failure count exceeds the specified threshold value, the circuit breaker will move to the Open state. If not, it will reset the failure count and timeout period.

## 4.  Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers

-  What do you mean by Cohesion and Coupling?
   - Coupling: It is defined as a relationship between softwae modules A and B, and how much one module depends on or interacts with another one. Couplings fall into three major categories. Modules can be highly coupled, loosely coupled, and uncoupled from each other. The best kind of coupling is loose coupling, which is achieved through interfaces.

   - Cohesion: It is defined as a relationship between two or more parts/elements of a module that serves the same purpose. Generally, a module with high cohesion can perform a specific function efficiently without needing communication with any other modules. High cohesion enhances the functionality of the module.

## 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

    b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions


- Round-robin Load Balancing: With round-robin load balancing, requests are distributed in a round-robin fashion across the different instances of a service. This approach is simple and easy to implement, but it may not be the most effective way to balance the load, especially if the instances have different capabilities.

- Weighted Load Balancing: Weighted load balancing involves assigning a weight to each instance of a service based on its capabilities and load. The load balancer then distributes the requests to the instances based on their weights. This approach allows for more effective load balancing, as it takes into account the capabilities of each instance. Least Connection Load Balancing: With least connection load balancing, the load balancer directs requests to the instance with the fewest active connections. This approach is effective at balancing the load across instances, but it requires more complex monitoring of the instances' connections.

- IP Hash Load Balancing: IP hash load balancing involves using the IP address of the client to determine which instance of a service to direct the request to. This approach ensures that requests from the same client are always directed to the same instance of the service, which can be useful for session management and other scenarios.

- Dynamic Load Balancing: Dynamic load balancing involves monitoring the load on each instance of a service and adjusting the load balancing strategy dynamically. This approach can be highly effective at balancing the load across instances, but it requires more complex monitoring and management infrastructure.
