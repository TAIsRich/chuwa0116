## 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md

## 2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
- Spring Cloud
- Zuul API Gateway (balancing loads of the micro-services)
- Eureka (Service Registry Center)
- Ribbon Load Balancer -> balancing loads of the providers
- Hystrix Circuit Breaker
- Config Server
- Kafka (Event based asynchronous communication between two services)
- åDocker (Deployment of services)

## 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

- Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. Common resiliency patterns used in application development include the bulkhead pattern and circuit breaker pattern.

- The circuit breaker allows microservices to communicate as usual and monitor the number of failures occurring within the defined time period. If the failure count exceeds the specified threshold value, the circuit breaker will move to the Open state. If not, it will reset the failure count and timeout period.

## 4.  Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers

## 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
