1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
2. Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies
   1. Spring Cloud
   2. Zuul API Gateway (balancing loads of the micro-services)
   3. Eureka (Service Registry Center)
   4. Ribbon **Load Balancer** -> balancing loads of the providers
   5. Hystrix **Circuit Breaker**
   6. Config Server
   7. Kafka (Event based asynchronous communication between two services)
   8. Docker (Deployment of services)
3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
   1. Definition: resilience patterns are a type of service that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve
      functionality in the event of service failures
   2. Circuit breaker is one of the patterns that opens when a system call results in an error and does not allow
      any calls to pass through
4. Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers
   a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#mai
   n-features-of-microservices
   * Write main components of Microservices.
     1. Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration
     2. IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception]
     3. Cloud Infrastructure
     4. API Gateway
     5. Enterprise Service Bus
     6. Service Delivery
   * What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?
     1. Benefits:
        * Self-contained, and independent deployment module.
        * Independently managed services.   
        * In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.   
        * It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.  
        * A greater degree of scalability and agility.   
        * Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.  
        * Better communication between developers and business users.   
        * Development teams of a smaller size.
     2. Drawbacks:
        * Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.  
        * Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.   
        * Pre-planning is essential.  
        * Complex development.  
        * Requires a cultural shift.  
        * Expensive compared to monoliths.   
        * Security implications.
        * Maintaining the network is more difficult.

5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
   a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview
   -question/
   b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions
   1. A load balancer is a critical component in system design, it's responsible for distributing incoming requests to 
      multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed and the overall system performance remains
      optimal, and when designing a load balancing system, we need to consider the following aspects:
      1. Load balancing algorithm (e.g. round-robin, session affinity, IP address affinity)
      2. Health checks: how lb tells which server is health and ready to take incoming request
      3. Session persistence: make sure subsequent request from the same user gets routed to the same server to maintain
         state
      4. Scalability: how the lb will scale as incoming requests kept coming more
      5. High availability: how the lb will make sure the system remains functional after experiencing failed servers
      6. Performance: how the lv will impact the latency, throughput of incoming requests.
   2. Where can we put the load balancers?
      1. Client <=> Server
      2. Web Front Servers (e.g. nodeJS) <=> Application Servers (e.g. nodeJS, Spring Web)
      3. Application Servers <=> Cache Servers (e.g. Redis)
      4. Cache Servers <=> Database Servers (e.g MySQL, PostSQL, MongoDB)
   3. Types of Load Balancers
      1. Software Load Balancers in Clients
         * The logic of load balancing is handled on the client side
      2. Software Load Balancers in Services
         * The software that can be installed on standard devices such as Windows or Linux machine and perform a set of 
           rules for filtering the incoming request, less expensive that the hardware load balancers
      3. Hardware Load Balancers
         * A physical appliance to distribute the traffic across the clusters of network servers, also known as Layer 4-7 Routers
           and is capable of handling HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP traffic
      4. Categories of Loading Balancing
         1. Layer 4 Load Balancer: transport layer (TCP/SSL) balancing, also know as **Network Load Balancing**
         2. Layer 7 Load Balancer: **Application Load Balancer** or **HTTP(S) Load Balancer**
         3. Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB): extends capability of L4 and L7 servers in different geographic locations
   4. Load Balancing Algorithms
      1. Round Robin: requests are distributed across the servers in a sequential or rotational manner, making sure
         all incoming requests are evenly distributed.
      2. Weighted Round Robin: depending on the weighted score the request is distributed to theses servers.
      3. Least Connection Method: request will be routed to the fewest number of requests or active connections.
      4. Lease Response Time Method: Lease Connection Method + lease average response time server
      5. Source IP Hash: requests is sent to the server based on the client's IP address
6. Udemy: Theory + CLI
