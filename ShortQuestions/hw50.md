### What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resilience patterns are design patterns that can be used to improve the reliability and fault tolerance of software systems. These patterns are designed to help systems continue functioning in the face of unexpected or unpredictable failures, such as network outages or hardware failures.

One of the most commonly used resilience patterns is the circuit breaker pattern. The circuit breaker pattern is a design pattern that helps to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems. It works by monitoring the state of a service or component and automatically "tripping" or "opening" a circuit when a certain threshold of errors is reached. Once the circuit is open, further requests to that service or component are redirected to a fallback mechanism, such as a cached response or a secondary service. This can help to prevent overloading the system and allow it to recover from the failure more quickly.

The circuit breaker pattern can also be used to detect and handle temporary failures, such as network timeouts or database connection errors. By temporarily "opening" the circuit, the system can prevent the failure from affecting other parts of the system and reduce the overall impact of the failure.

In summary, resilience patterns like the circuit breaker pattern are an important part of building reliable and fault-tolerant software systems that can continue to function in the face of unexpected or unpredictable failures.

### What are the main features of Microservices?

- **Decoulping**: Within a system, services are largely decoupled. The application as a whole can therefore be easily constructed, altered, and scalable.
- **Responsibility:** Microservices are not focused on applications as projects. Rather, they see applications as products they are responsible for.
- **Agility:** Microservices facilitate agile development. It is possible to create new features quickly and discard them again at any time.

### What are the main components of Microservices?

- Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration 
- IaC [Infrastructure as Code] 
- Cloud Infrastructure 
- API Gateway 
- Enterprise Service Bus 
- Service Delivery 

### What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?

**Benefits**

- You can update/modify one service without the downtime of the entire application.
- You can easily scale the system to add more services.
- For each service, you can use different tech stacks.

**Drawbacks**

- Communication between services requires more time and resources.
- DevOps – need more server and people to maintain each servers.

### How to do load balance in microservice?

What is a Load Balancer?

A load balancer works as a “traffic cop” sitting in front of your server and routing client requests across all servers. It simply distributes the set of requested operations (database write requests, cache queries) effectively across multiple servers and ensures that no single server bears too many requests that lead to degrading the overall performance of the application. A load balancer can be a physical device or a virtualized instance running on specialized hardware or a software process. 

Where Are Load Balancers Typically Placed?

- In between the client application/user and the server
- In between the server and the application/job servers
- In between the application servers and the cache servers
- In between the cache servers the database servers

Load Balancing Algorithms

- Round Robin
- Weighted Round Robin
- Least Connection Method
- Least Response Time Method
- Source IP Hash

How to use Load Balancing?

- A load balancer enables elastic scalability which improves the performance and throughput of data. It allows you to keep many copies of data (redundancy) to ensure the availability of the system. In case a server goes down or fails you’ll have the backup to restore the services. 
- Load balancers can be placed at any software layer.
- Many companies use both hardware and software to implement the load balancers, depending on the different scale points in their system.
