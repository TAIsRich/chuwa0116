### 1.  list all the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
### 2.  Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies
Components:
1. API Gateway: The API Gateway is the entry point for client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice. It handles tasks such as load balancing, routing, and authentication.

2. Microservices: These are the individual services that make up the application. They are designed to be small and focused on a single task, and communicate with each other over a network.

3. Service Registry: The Service Registry is used to keep track of the available microservices and their current status. It enables the API Gateway to route client requests to the appropriate service.

4. Service Discovery: The Service Discovery component is used to locate the available instances of a particular microservice. It allows the API Gateway to distribute requests evenly across multiple instances of a service.

5. Configuration Server: The Configuration Server is responsible for managing the configuration of the microservices. It stores configuration files in a centralized location and distributes them to the appropriate microservices.

6. Database: Microservices often need to store and retrieve data, so a database is an important component. Databases can be shared by multiple microservices or each service can have its own dedicated database.

Tools/Dependencies:

1. Docker: Docker is a containerization platform that allows microservices to be packaged as containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be easily deployed across different environments.

2. Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an orchestration platform that manages and scales containers. It provides tools for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.

3. Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a popular Java-based framework for building microservices. It provides tools for quickly creating and deploying microservices, and integrates with other components such as the Service Registry and Configuration Server.

4. Netflix OSS: Netflix OSS is a collection of open-source tools and libraries for building microservices. It includes components such as the API Gateway, Service Registry, and Service Discovery.

5. Kafka: Kafka is a message broker that enables microservices to communicate with each other asynchronously. It supports multiple messaging protocols and can be used to implement event-driven architectures.

6. Redis: Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used for caching and as a message broker. It can be used to improve the performance and scalability of microservices.

7. Apache Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable NoSQL database that can be used to store large amounts of data. It can be used by microservices to store and retrieve data in a distributed manner.

### 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resilience patterns are design patterns that are used in distributed systems to improve fault tolerance, reliability, and stability. These patterns are used to handle failure scenarios such as network outages, server failures, and service degradation. Resilience patterns aim to prevent cascading failures and ensure that the system remains operational even when individual components fail.

One important resilience pattern is the Circuit Breaker pattern. A Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used to prevent a system from becoming overwhelmed by repeated failures. It is used to detect failures and stop sending requests to a service that is experiencing issues. When a Circuit Breaker detects a failure, it trips and redirects traffic to an alternate path or fallback mechanism.


### 4.  Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers
    a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices
#### What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?
Benefits:

- Self-contained, and independent deployment module.
- Independently managed services.   
- In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.   
- It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.  
- A greater degree of scalability and agility.   
- Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.  
- Better communication between developers and business users.   
- Development teams of a smaller size.

Drawbacks:
- Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.  
- Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.   
- Pre-planning is essential.  
- Complex development.  
- Requires a cultural shift.  
- Expensive compared to monoliths.   
- Security implications.
- Maintaining the network is more difficult.
#### Write main components of Microservices.
- Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration
- IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception]
- Cloud Infrastructure
- API Gateway
- Enterprise Service Bus
- Service Delivery
#### Write main features of Microservices.
- Decoupling: Within a system, services are largely decoupled. The application as a whole can therefore be easily constructed, altered, and scalable
- Componentization: Microservices are viewed as independent components that can easily be exchanged or upgraded
- Business Capabilities: Microservices are relatively simple and only focus on one service
- Team autonomy: Each developer works independently of each other, allowing for a faster project timeline
- Continuous Delivery: Enables frequent software releases through systematic automation of software development, testing, and approval
- Responsibility: Microservices are not focused on applications as projects. Rather, they see applications as products they are responsible for
- Decentralized Governance: Choosing the right tool according to the job is the goal. Developers can choose the best tools to solve their problems
- Agility: Microservices facilitate agile development. It is possible to create new features quickly and discard them again at any time.


### 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
    a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview
    -question/
    b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions
1. Client-side load balancing: In this approach, the client application is responsible for selecting which instance of a microservice to send requests to. The client typically uses a load balancing algorithm to distribute the workload evenly across the available instances of the microservice.
2. Server-side load balancing: In this approach, a load balancer component sits between the client and the microservice instances, routing requests to the appropriate instance based on a load balancing algorithm. The load balancer can be implemented as a separate microservice or as part of a service mesh architecture.
3. DNS-based load balancing: In this approach, multiple IP addresses are associated with a single hostname, and the DNS server returns a different IP address for each request. The client then sends requests to the different IP addresses in a round-robin fashion.
4. Container orchestration: In container-based microservices architecture, container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes provide built-in load balancing capabilities. Kubernetes uses a load balancing algorithm to distribute requests across multiple replicas of a microservice running in different containers.
