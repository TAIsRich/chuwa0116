### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2. What is MVC pattern?
Model-View_Controller. Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.
### 3. What is Front-Controller?
The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern catalogs and is related to the design of web applications. It is "a controller that handles all requests for a website,"[1] which is a useful structure for web application developers to achieve flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.
### 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works
DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on
useful business logic.
1.  Tomcat receives Http Request，send that request to DispatcherServlet
2.  DispatcherServlet calls HandlerMapper using that request
3.  HanslerMapper find method in Controller，and send it back to DispatcherServlet
4.  DispatcherServlet calls the method that Controller provides，which will trigger call service,
    repository and database.
5.  ModelAndView will be sent back by Controller. Returb view name, String, such as list-customers. Data is set to model.
6.  dispatcerServlet uses view name to call view Resolver,
7. View Resolver will help us find out view template, such as list-customers.jsp
8.  Now we have view template, and data model. we can now call View engine to help us put data into view template, and translate to pure HTML.

9.  This HTML is the content of the front end, and it is sent back to browser.

### 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)

JSP:
- It stands for Java Server Pages.
- It is a server side technology.
- It is used for creating web application.
- It is used to create dynamic web content.
- In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages.
- It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology.
- It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform independent web pages.
- In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both.
- JSP is first converted into servlet by JSP container before processing the client’s request.

ModelAndView:
ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value.

### 6.   Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
Generic servlets: Extend javax.servlet.GenericServlet.
HTTP servlets: Extend javax.servlet.HttpServlet.

### 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
Apache, IIS, lighttpd and Jagsaw
### 8.clone this repo, and run it in you local
