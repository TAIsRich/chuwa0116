## 2.  What is the authentication?
-  **Authentication** is the process of determining whether or not an entity is who or what it declares itself to be

## 3.  What is the authorization?
- **Authorization** is the process of giving an entity permission to do, use, or obtain something. Logically, authentication precedes authorization


## 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- The best way to illustrate the differences between the two terms is with a simple example. Let's say you decide to go and visit a friend's home. On arrival, you knock on the door, and your friend opens it. She recognizes you (authentication) and greets you. As your friend has authenticated you, she is now comfortable letting you into her home. However, based on your relationship, there are certain things you can do and others you cannot (authorization). For example, you may enter the kitchen area, but you cannot go into her private office. In other words, you have the authorization to enter the kitchen, but access to her private office is prohibited.


## 5.  What is HTTP Session?
- HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application

## 6.  What is Cookie? 
- Simply put, a cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. They're used to identify a client when sending a subsequent request. They can also be used for passing some data from one servlet to another.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

## 9.  What is JWT?
**JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
- The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.


## 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
Here are the steps involved in the JWT workflow:

- Authentication: The user logs in to the application and provides their credentials. The server verifies the credentials and generates a JWT token.
- Token generation: The server generates a JWT token that contains user information such as the user ID, name, email, and any additional metadata or claims. This token is signed using a secret key or private key to prevent tampering.
- Token storage: The token is typically stored on the client-side, either in a cookie or local storage.
- API requests: The client includes the JWT token in the headers or body of subsequent requests to the application's APIs.
- Token verification: The server verifies the token's signature and decodes the payload to determine the user's identity and authorization status. If the token is valid, the server returns the requested data or performs the requested action.
- Token refresh: If the token has expired, the server can generate a new token and send it back to the client.

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
In a web application, it is important to store user passwords in an encrypted and secure format to prevent unauthorized access. Password encryption is typically done using an encoder, which takes the plain text password as input and generates a hashed or encrypted version of the password that can be stored in the database. Here are some common password encoders used in web applications:

- BCryptPasswordEncoder: This is a widely-used password encoder that is part of the Spring Security framework. It generates a hash of the password using the BCrypt algorithm, which is considered a strong hashing algorithm. The BCryptPasswordEncoder can be configured with a strength value that determines the number of rounds used to generate the hash, making it more difficult for attackers to crack the password.

- PBKDF2PasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm to generate a hash of the password. It takes several parameters, including a salt value and an iteration count, which can be configured to increase the strength of the hash.
- SCryptPasswordEncoder: This encoder uses the scrypt key derivation function to generate a hash of the password. The scrypt algorithm is designed to be memory-hard, making it difficult to perform brute-force attacks against the hashed password.
- Argon2PasswordEncoder: This is a newer password encoder that uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm to generate a hash of the password. Argon2 is considered a highly secure algorithm and is recommended by the Password Hashing Competition (PHC) for password hashing.

In summary, password encoders are used to generate a hashed or encrypted version of a user's password, which can be securely stored in the database. There are several different encoders available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. It is important to choose an encoder that is appropriate for your application's security requirements and to configure it properly to ensure the strongest possible protection for user passwords.

## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
In Spring Security, AuthenticationFilter, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationProvider, and UserDetailService are key components of the authentication and authorization process:

- UserDetailsService: This is an interface that is used to load user-specific data. It is typically implemented to retrieve user details such as username, password, and roles from a database or other data source. The UserDetailsService is used by the AuthenticationProvider to authenticate a user.

- AuthenticationFilter: This is a Spring Security filter that intercepts incoming authentication requests and extracts the user's credentials from the request, typically from the request headers or request body. The AuthenticationFilter then creates an Authentication object and passes it to the AuthenticationManager to authenticate the user.
- AuthenticationManager: This is an interface that is responsible for managing the authentication process. It delegates the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProviders, which are responsible for authenticating the user. The AuthenticationManager returns the Authentication object if the user is authenticated, or throws an AuthenticationException if the authentication fails.

- AuthenticationProvider: This is an interface that is responsible for authenticating a user. It uses the UserDetailService to retrieve the user's details and then verifies the user's credentials. If the user is authenticated, the AuthenticationProvider creates an Authentication object containing the user's principal (username) and credentials (password) and sets its authentication status to true.


Together, these components provide a comprehensive authentication and authorization solution for Spring Security applications. The AuthenticationFilter extracts the user's credentials and creates an Authentication object, which is then passed to the AuthenticationManager. The AuthenticationManager delegates the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProviders, which use the UserDetailService to retrieve user details and authenticate the user. By combining these components, developers can create a secure and reliable authentication and authorization mechanism for their Spring Security applications.



## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
- 1.  Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 
- 2.  Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.

## 17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable framework for securing Java applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for implementing authentication and authorization in your application.

- Authentication:   
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In Spring Security, authentication can be performed using a variety of mechanisms, including form-based authentication, token-based authentication, and social login. The framework provides a flexible and extensible authentication mechanism that can be customized to meet the specific needs of your application.

- Authorization:   
Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource. In Spring Security, authorization is typically based on roles and permissions, which are defined in a security configuration file. The framework provides a powerful and flexible authorization mechanism that allows you to define fine-grained access control policies based on the user's role, the resource being accessed, and other factors.
