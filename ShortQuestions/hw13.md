## 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
## 2.  What is the authentication?
-  **Authentication** is the process of determining whether or not an entity is who or what it declares itself to be

## 3.  What is the authorization?
- **Authorization** is the process of giving an entity permission to do, use, or obtain something. Logically, authentication precedes authorization


## 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- The best way to illustrate the differences between the two terms is with a simple example. Let's say you decide to go and visit a friend's home. On arrival, you knock on the door, and your friend opens it. She recognizes you (authentication) and greets you. As your friend has authenticated you, she is now comfortable letting you into her home. However, based on your relationship, there are certain things you can do and others you cannot (authorization). For example, you may enter the kitchen area, but you cannot go into her private office. In other words, you have the authorization to enter the kitchen, but access to her private office is prohibited.
