## 2. What is MVC pattern?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controlle

Model: The model component is responsible for managing the application's data, performing data validation and enforcing business rules.

View: The view is responsible for rendering the data provided by the model and for receiving user input. 

Controller: The controller is responsible for receiving user input from the view, updating the model, and updating the view to reflect changes in the model.

## 3. What is Front-Controller?

A Front Controller is a single controller component is responsible for handling all requests for the application. The front controller acts as an entry point for all incoming requests, and it is responsible for dispatching the request to the appropriate handler or controller that will process the request.

##　4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works

In the Spring Framework, the DispatcherServlet is a servlet that acts as the front controller for Spring-based web applications. It is responsible for handling all incoming requests and delegating the processing to the appropriate controller or handler.

When a request is made to a Spring web application, the DispatcherServlet intercepts the request and consults a set of mappings to determine which controller or handler should process the request. The mappings are defined in the DispatcherServlet configuration and can be based on the URL, request parameters, or other criteria.

Once the DispatcherServlet has determined the appropriate controller or handler, it invokes the corresponding method and passes the request to it. The controller or handler processes the request and returns a model and view to the DispatcherServlet.

The DispatcherServlet then consults a view resolver to determine which view should be used to render the response. The view resolver is also configured in the DispatcherServlet configuration and can be based on the view name, the URL, or other criteria.

Once the view resolver has determined the appropriate view, the DispatcherServlet passes the model to the view and instructs it to render the response. The view generates the HTML or other content that is sent back to the client as the response.

## 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？

JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used in web development to create dynamic web pages by embedding Java code within HTML. JSP pages are compiled at runtime into servlets, which are Java classes that can generate HTML output dynamically.

A ModelAndView is a Spring Framework class that combines both a data model and a view. It is commonly used to pass data between a controller and a view in a Spring-based web application. The model represents the data that needs to be passed to the view, while the view represents the presentation of the data.

## 6. Could you please google any other servlets

HttpServlet - This is the base class for all HTTP servlets, and provides methods for handling HTTP requests and responses.

Cookie - This servlet can be used to create, retrieve, and manipulate cookies in an HTTP request and response.

HttpSession - This servlet can be used to store and retrieve data associated with a user session in an HTTP request.
