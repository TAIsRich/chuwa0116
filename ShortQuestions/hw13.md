### What is authentication?
* Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.
### What is authorization?
* Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a resource.
### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
* In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system
* In authorization process, one's authorities are checked for accessing the resources
### What is HTTP Session?
* HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
### What is Cookie?
* Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network.
### What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
* Cookies are client-side files that are stored on a local computer and contain user information. Sessions are server-side files that store user information.
### How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
* Cookies are considered to be less safe than sessions since a third-party can manipulate the data that is stored in them, whereas sessions are stored in an encrypted form that the user alone can read.
* Sessions also save the passwords on the computer and form data, which means that every time the user accesses an application, that program will not ask the user to log in again. This is because the passwords and form data are saved.
### What is JWT
* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP).
### What is the spring security filter?
* The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.
### Describe how JWT Works?
* Post /authenticate with username and password
* Validate the username and password. Generate the JWT using secret key
* Return the generated JWT
* GET /hello with JWT in the Header
* Validate JWT using secret key
* return the response
### What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?
* UserDetailsService is used by DaoAuthenticationProvider for retrieving a username, a password, and other attributes for authenticating with a username and password.
### What is the disadvantage of Session? How to overcome the disadvantage?
* Performance overhead in case of large volumes of data/user, because session data is stored in server memory. Overhead involved in serializing and de-serializing session data, because in the case of StateServer and SQLServer session modes, we need to serialize the objects before storing them.
### How to get values from application.properties?
* You can use @Value("${property-name}") from the application. properties if your class is annotated with @Configuration or @Component .
### What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
* configure(HttpSecurity) allows configuration of web based security at a resource level, based on a selection match
* AuthenticationManagerBuilder is a helper class that eases the set up of UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, and other dependencies to build an AuthenticationManager.
### What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
* Spring Security is really just a bunch of servlet filters that help you add authentication and authorization to your web application.
