## 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
## 2.  What is the authentication?
-  **Authentication** is the process of determining whether or not an entity is who or what it declares itself to be

## 3.  What is the authorization?
- **Authorization** is the process of giving an entity permission to do, use, or obtain something. Logically, authentication precedes authorization


## 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- The best way to illustrate the differences between the two terms is with a simple example. Let's say you decide to go and visit a friend's home. On arrival, you knock on the door, and your friend opens it. She recognizes you (authentication) and greets you. As your friend has authenticated you, she is now comfortable letting you into her home. However, based on your relationship, there are certain things you can do and others you cannot (authorization). For example, you may enter the kitchen area, but you cannot go into her private office. In other words, you have the authorization to enter the kitchen, but access to her private office is prohibited.


## 5.  What is HTTP Session?
- HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application

## 6.  What is Cookie? 
- Simply put, a cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side which servers use when communicating with clients. They're used to identify a client when sending a subsequent request. They can also be used for passing some data from one servlet to another.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

<table><tbody><tr><td><p 
style="text-align:center"><strong>Cookie</strong></p></td><td><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Session</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information.</td><td>Sessions are server-side files that contain user data.</td></tr><tr><td>Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user.</td><td>When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over.</td></tr><tr><td>It can only store a certain amount of info.</td><td>It can hold an indefinite quantity of data.</td></tr><tr><td>The browser’s cookies have a maximum capacity of 4 KB.</td><td>We can keep as much data as we like within a session, however there is a maximum memory restriction of 128 MB that a script may consume at one time.</td></tr><tr><td>Because cookies are kept on the local computer, we don’t need to run a function to start them.</td><td>To begin the session, we must use the session start() method.</td></tr><tr><td>Cookies are not secured.</td><td>Session are more secured compare than cookies.</td></tr><tr><td>Cookies stored data in text file.</td><td>Session save data in encrypted form.</td></tr><tr><td>Cookies stored on a limited data.</td><td>Session stored a unlimited data.</td></tr><tr><td>In PHP, to get the data from Cookies , $_COOKIES the global variable is used</td><td>In PHP &nbsp;, to get the data from Session, $_SESSION the global variable is used</td></tr><tr><td>We can set an expiration date to delete the cookie’s data. It will automatically delete the data at that specific time.&nbsp;</td><td>In PHP, to destroy or remove the data stored within a session, we can use the session_destroy() function, and to unset a specific variable, we can use the unset() function.</td></tr></tbody></table>
## 8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 

## 9.  What is JWT?
**JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the **HMAC** algorithm) or a public/private key pair using **RSA** or **ECDSA**.

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
- The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
- 1.  Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 
- 2.  Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.
