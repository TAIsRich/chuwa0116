1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
   annotaitons.md
2. What is MVC pattern?

   MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software design pattern used in the development of applications, particularly those that involve user interfaces.

The Model-View-Controller pattern separates an application into three interconnected components:

Model: represents the application's data and the rules that govern how that data is accessed and manipulated.

View: provides the user interface that displays the data and enables users to interact with it.

Controller: mediates between the Model and the View, receiving input from the View and updating the Model accordingly, as well as updating the View in response to changes in the Model.


3. What is Front-Controller?

   The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller.

4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

   DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on
   useful business logic:
   - Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method
   - Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or
   domain objects
   - Model-view-controller interaction
   - Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.
     Tomcat 收到Http Request，将request交给DispatcherServlet来处理
   1. DispatcherServlet 拿着该req去call HandlerMapper,
   2. HanlerMapper将会找到对应的Controller以及对应的method，并返回给
      dispactherServlet
   3. dispatcherServlet将call该Controller对应的method，此时会触发call service,
      repository and database.
   4. 然后结果(ModelAndView)再通过Controller返回。⼀般是返回view name, ⼀个字
      符串，⽐如list-customers. ⽽数据是要set到Model 中。
   5. dispatcerServlet拿着view name去call view Resolver,
   6. View Resolver会帮助我们找到view template, ⽐如list-customers.jsp
   7. 此时我们有了view template, 也有了数据model，则可以call View engine去帮助我
      们把数据放到view templatel⾥，然后转换成纯粹的HTML
   8. 该HTML就是前端显⽰的内容，最终返回给browser。

5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic
   knowlege)

   JSP is a technology that enables the creation of dynamic web pages based on HTML and Java code.

   ModelAndView is a class in the Spring Framework used to pass data between a controller and a view in a Spring MVC application.
6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，
   知道servlet的名字就⾏。)

   - HttpServlet: This is an abstract class that extends the GenericServlet class and provides methods for handling HTTP-specific requests and responses.

   - Filter: A filter is a Java class that is used to intercept and process requests and responses before they are handled by a servlet or JSP page.

   - RequestDispatcher: This is an interface that allows a servlet to forward a request to another resource (such as another servlet or JSP page) for processing.

   - ServletContext: This is an interface that provides a way for servlets to communicate with the web application container (such as Tomcat or Jetty) and share data with other servlets.

   - HttpSession: This is an interface that provides a way for servlets to store and retrieve user-specific data across multiple requests.

   - SingleThreadModel: This is an interface that allows a servlet to handle one request at a time, which can be useful in certain scenarios where thread safety is a concern.
7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
   Apache Tomcat: This is a widely used open-source web server and servlet container that is often used for deploying Java-based web applications.

Jetty: This is another open-source web server and servlet container that is known for its high performance and small footprint.

JBoss/WildFly: This is an open-source application server that includes a web server component and supports a wide range of Java technologies, including JavaServer Pages (JSP) and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

Apache HTTP Server: This is a popular open-source web server that supports multiple programming languages, including Java via the mod_jk and mod_proxy_ajp modules.

IBM WebSphere: This is a commercial web server and application server that is often used for enterprise-level Java web applications.

Oracle WebLogic: This is another commercial web server and application server that is often used for enterprise-level Java web applications.
