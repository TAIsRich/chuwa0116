## 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
## 2.  What is the authentication?
    Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically by requiring the user to provide a username and password combination. 

## 3.  What is the authorization?
    Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.

## 4.  What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
    Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.

## 5.  What is HTTP Session?
    HTTP Session is a mechanism for storing information about a user's interactions with a web application. It allows the server to maintain state and track a user's activity across multiple requests.

## 6.  What is Cookie? 
    A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent by a website to a user's web browser. The browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the website with each subsequent request.

## 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
    A session is a server-side mechanism for storing information about a user's interactions with a web application, while a cookie is a client-side mechanism for storing data on a user's computer.

## 8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
    To use session and cookie to keep user information across the application, we can store the relevant information in the session or a cookie when the user logs in or performs some action, and retrieve the information as needed from the session or cookie on subsequent requests.

## 9.  What is JWT?
    JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs can be used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications.

## 10. What is the spring security filter?
    The Spring Security filter is a set of filters that intercept incoming HTTP requests and apply security-related functionality, such as authentication and authorization, to those requests.

## 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
    JWT works by encoding user data into a token, which is then sent to the server with each subsequent request. The server can then decode the token and use the information to authenticate and authorize the user.

## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
    Yes, we can use an encoder to encode passwords in Spring Boot. One example is the BCryptPasswordEncoder, which is provided by Spring Security and uses a one-way hashing function to encode passwords.
    
## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
    UserDetailService is an interface used to retrieve user details from a data store, such as a database. AuthenticationProvider is an interface used to authenticate a user based on a given set of credentials. AuthenticationManager is responsible for coordinating the authentication process by delegating to one or more AuthenticationProviders. AuthenticationFilter is a Spring Security filter that handles the initial stages of the authentication process by intercepting and processing incoming authentication requests.

## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    One disadvantage of using session is that it can lead to scalability issues, as the server needs to maintain a separate session for each user. To overcome this disadvantage, we can use stateless authentication mechanisms, such as JWTs, that do not require server-side storage of user data.

## 15. how to get value from application.properties?
    We can get values from application.properties using the @Value annotation or the Environment object.

## 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
    The configure(HttpSecurity http) method is used to configure the security-related aspects of the HTTP request-response cycle, such as authentication and authorization. The configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method is used to configure the AuthenticationManager, which is responsible for authenticating users based on a given set of credentials.

## 17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
    Spring Security authentication and authorization are mechanisms for protecting web applications from unauthorized access. Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization is the process of determining whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action.
