### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. What is MVC pattern?
```
MVC, standing for Model–view–controller, is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.
Model - Model represents an object or JAVA POJO carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.
View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains.
Controller - Controller acts on both model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It keeps view and model separate.
```

### 3. What is Front-Controller?
```
The front controller design pattern means that all requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler and then dispatched to the appropriate handler for that type of request. The front controller may use other helpers to achieve the dispatching mechanism. Following are the entities of this type of design pattern.
Front Controller - Single handler for all kinds of requests coming to the application (either web based/ desktop based).
Dispatcher - Front Controller may use a dispatcher object which can dispatch the request to corresponding specific handler.
View - Views are the object for which the requests are made.
Helper - A helper is responsible for helping a view or controller complete its processing.
```

### 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.
```
DispatcherServlet handles an incoming HttpRequest, delegates the request, and processes that request according to the configured HandlerAdapter interfaces that have been implemented within the Spring application along with accompanying annotations specifying handlers, controller endpoints, and response objects.

1. Tomcat 收到Http Request，将request交给DispatcherServlet来处理
2. DispatcherServlet 拿着该req去call HandlerMapper, 
3. HanlerMapper将会找到对应的Controller以及对应的method，并返回给dispactherServlet
4. dispatcherServlet将call该Controller对应的method，此时会触发call service, repository and database. 
5. 然后结果(ModelAndView)再通过Controller返回。一般是返回view name, 一个字符串，比如list-customers. 而数据是要set到Model 中。
6. dispatcerServlet拿着view name去call view Resolver, 
7. View Resolver会帮助我们找到view template, 比如list-customers.jsp
8. 此时我们有了view template, 也有了数据model，则可以call View engine去帮助我们把数据放到view templatel里，然后转换成纯粹的HTML
9. 该HTML就是前端显示的内容，最终返回给browser。
```

### 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)
```
JSP, standing for Java Server Pages, is a server side technology. It is used for creating web application and used to create dynamic web content.

ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value.
The view is resolved by a ViewResolver object; the model is data stored in a Map.
```

### 6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
```
Filter, RequestDispatcher, HttpServlet, SingleThreadModel
```

### 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
```
Tomcat - This is a widely used open-source web server and servlet container that is often used for deploying Java-based web applications.
Jetty - This is another open-source web server and servlet container that is known for its high performance and small footprint.
JBoss - This is an open-source application server that includes a web server component and supports a wide range of Java technologies, including JavaServer Pages (JSP) and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
Oracle WebLogic - This is a commercial web server and application server that is often used for enterprise-level Java web applications.
```
