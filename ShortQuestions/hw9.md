# Homework 9

### 1. List all of the new annotations to your annotaitons.md and explain its role.

### 2. how do you do the debug?

### 3. What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO?
The terms DTO, VO, Payload, and DO are used in software development to represent different concepts related to data transfer and storage. Here is a brief explanation of each term:

DTO (Data Transfer Object): A DTO is an object that is used to transfer data between layers or components of an application. It is used to encapsulate data in a format that can be easily serialized and transmitted over a network, or to represent data that is being passed from one layer of an application to another.

VO (Value Object): A VO is similar to a DTO, but it is focused on representing the value of an object rather than its state. VOs are used to pass values between layers or components of an application and are often used in situations where the data being transferred is immutable.

Payload: The payload is the actual data being transferred in a request or response. It is the data that is carried by a message, such as an HTTP request or a message sent over a network. The payload can be serialized in different formats, such as JSON or XML, and can be used to represent DTOs, VOs, or other data structures.

DO (Data Object): A DO is an object that represents data in a persistent storage layer, such as a database. A DO is typically used to represent a single record in a database table and is used to map data between the database and the application's business logic.

It is important to note that these terms can have different meanings in different contexts, and the exact definition may vary depending on the context and the specific implementation.

### 4. What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")

### 5. do you know what is jackson?
Jackson is a suite of data-processing tools for Java (and the JVM platform), including the flagship streaming JSON parser / generator library, matching data-binding library (POJOs to and from JSON) and additional data format modules to process data encoded in Avro, BSON, CBOR, CSV, Smile, (Java) Properties, Protobuf, TOML, XML or YAML; and even the large set of data format modules to support data types of widely used data types such as Guava, Joda, PCollections and many

### 6. What is spring-boot-stater?
Spring Boot Starters are dependency descriptors that can be added under the <dependencies> section in pom. xml. There are around 50+ Spring Boot Starters for different Spring and related technologies. These starters give all the dependencies under a single name.

### 7. do you know @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) ? could you list CRUD by this style?

### 8. What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?
ResponseEntity represents the whole HTTP response: status code, headers, and body. As a result, we can use it to fully configure the HTTP response.

### 9. What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC
The ResultSet is a table of data generated by executing database queries. 

### 10. What is the ORM framework?
Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between a relational database and the heap of an object-oriented programming language. This creates, in effect, a virtual object database that can be used from within the programming language. 

### 11. Learn how to use ObjectMapper by this example.

### 12. What is the serialization and desrialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object. 

### 13. use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].
```java
public double calculateAverage(int[] arr) {
  return arr.stream()
          .average()
          .getAsDouble();
}
```

### 14, add new code

### 15. optional

### 16. Try to write the CRUD api for a new application Cassandra-Blog
