## 1. List all of the new annotations to your annotations.md and explain its role.

## 2. how do you do the debug?
- break point
- start debug (debug button)
- send request
- step in / step over / step out / continue execution to examine the code


## 3. What is DTO, VO, Payload, DO?
- DTO: A simple Java object used to transfer data between different layers or parts of an application. They are often used as a standard way to pass data from a service layer to a presentation layer, for example, from a REST API to a client-side interface.
- VO: A Java object that represents a specific value or set of values. A VO is often used to encapsulate data that has meaning as a group, such as an address or a date range.
- Payload: In the context of Java development, "payload" refers to the data being transmitted or carried by a request, such as in an HTTP request or a message sent over a network.
- DO: A data object is a plain old Java object (POJO) that is used to store data in the application. DOs are often used to model database tables or other data sources, and are used to persist data to and retrieve data from the database.


## 4. What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds") (不会的话，课上问)?
Use this annotation to rename the variable because the JSON is coming from another environment where properties start different name.

## 5. do you know what is jackson?
Yes, Jackson is a popular Java library used for processing JSON data format. It provides functionality for reading and writing JSON data and allows developers to easily parse JSON data into Java objects and serialize Java objects into JSON. It's known for its fast performance, ease of use, and flexible configuration options.

## 6. What is spring-boot-starter?
Spring Boot Starters are dependency descriptors that can be added under the <dependencies> section in pom.xml. There are around 50+ Spring Boot Starters for different Spring and related technologies. These starters give all the dependencies under a single name.
6.a uses spring-boot-starter-web; other starters are spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for example.

## 7. do you know @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST) ? could you list CRUD by this style?
@RequestMapping Annotation which is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.

@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.PUT)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)

## 8. What is ResponseEntity? why do we need it?
ResponseEntity represents the whole HTTP response: status code, headers, and body. As a result, we can use it to fully configure the HTTP response. If we want to use it, we have to return it from the endpoint; Spring takes care of the rest.

## 9. What is ResultSet in jdbc? and describe the flow how to get data using JDBC
ResultSet in JDBC is a data structure that holds the result set generated by a SELECT statement executed on a database. It acts as a cursor pointing to a row of the result set and allows iteration over the rows to retrieve data.

The general flow to retrieve data using JDBC can be summarized as follows:

Load the JDBC driver class: The first step is to load the JDBC driver class, which is specific to the database management system being used.

Establish a connection to the database: The second step is to establish a connection to the database by providing the connection URL, username, and password.

Create a statement: A statement object is created to send SQL statements to the database.

Execute the query: A SELECT statement is executed using the statement object to retrieve data from the database.

Process the result set: The result set returned by the query is processed using a ResultSet object, which is obtained by calling the statement object's executeQuery method.

Retrieve the data: The data can be retrieved from the result set by calling its various get methods (e.g., getInt, getString, etc.). The rows of the result set can be processed using a loop that calls the ResultSet's next method to move the cursor to the next row.

Close the connection: Finally, the connection is closed to free up resources.

## 10. What is the ORM framework?
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It's a technique used in software development to map the objects in an application to the data stored in a relational database. An ORM framework provides a higher-level API for interacting with a database, allowing developers to interact with the data using objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries. This helps to abstract the underlying database structure and simplify the database interaction code, making it easier to maintain and test the application.

## 11. Learn how to use ObjectMapper by this example.
We can use ObjectMapper to parse or deserialize JSON content into a Java object.

Also, on the writing side, we can use the writeValue API to serialize any Java object as JSON output.

## 12. What is the serialization and deserialization? a. https://hazelcast.com/glossary/serialization/
Serialization is the process of converting a data object—a combination of code and data represented within a region of data storage—into a series of bytes that saves the state of the object in an easily transmittable form.

The reverse process—constructing a data structure or object from a series of bytes—is deserialization. The deserialization process recreates the object, thus making the data easier to read and modify as a native structure in a programming language.

## 13. use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].
```aidl
int[] temp = new int[] {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
System.out.println(Arrays.stream(temp).average()); // OptionalDouble[39.7]
```
