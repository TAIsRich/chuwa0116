2. What is the authentication?

   User have the right account and password to log in, authentication.
3. What is the authorization?

   User logged in, but there are restriction on the role and capacity of users.
4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

   Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
5. What is HTTP Session?

   HTTP sessions is an session factory that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
   the server uses a session ID to identify actions initiated by this specific user, making it possible for user to making stateless http requests without the need to log in again.The info will be stored until the user logging out
6. What is Cookie?

   A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web browser that the website can retrieve at a later time.

       The working mechnism of Cookie is that after the first login, the server returns
       some data (cookies) to the browser, and then the browser saves it locally. When the user sends the second request,
       the cookie data stored in the last request will be automatically carried to the server.
7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

- Cookie can be stored in the browser or on the local personal computer, and sessions can only be stored on the server.
- Session can store any java object, while cookie can only store String objects
- Session is more secure than Cookie. (Cookie has security risks, and can be attacked by interception or local files to find your cookie)
- Sessions occupy server performance. Hence, too many sessions increase the pressure of the server.
- The data saved by a single Cookie cannot exceed 4K, so many browsers limit a site to save a maximum of 20 cookies.
While the Session has no size limit and is related to the memory size of the server.

8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
   application?
- When a user logs in or performs any action that requires persistent data, the server creates a unique session for that user and generates a session ID. This session ID is stored on the server along with any relevant user data.

- The server sends the session ID to the client in a cookie or as a URL parameter. If the server sends the session ID in a cookie, the cookie is stored on the client's browser.

- The client sends the session ID back to the server with each subsequent request. The server uses the session ID to retrieve the user's data and perform any necessary actions.

- When the user logs out or the session expires, the server deletes the session and the associated data.
9. What is JWT?

   JWT is Json Web Token that is used between a user and sever to identify an encrypted session.
10. What is the spring security filter?

    The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
    
    1. Post /authenticate with username and password
    2. Validate the username and password. Generate the JWT using secret key
    3. Return the generated JWT
    4. GET /hello with JWT in the Header
    5. Validate JWT using secret key
    6. Return the response

12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

    Yes, I use BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode the password.
13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)

- UserDetails Services queries the user information from database.
- AuthenticationProvider calls UserDetails and includes the business logic to check if the input matches the data stored in database. 
- Authentication Manager delegates the request to Authentication Provider.
- Authentication Filter creates an Authentication Request and passes it to Authentication Provider.

14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    
    The main disadvantages of using sessions is that they consume server resources, especially when large amounts of data are stored in a session. This can lead to performance issues, especially on heavily-trafficked websites with many concurrent users.

    How to overcome: Limit the amount of data stored in a session, Set an appropriate timeout value, Use server-side session storage, Use cookie-based sessions
15. how to get value from application.properties?

    using @Value annotation.
16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

    onfigure(HttpSecurity http) configures authorization based on url.
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auto) adds properties to a new/existing authenticationManager, used to configure the AuthenticationManager, which is used for
    all userDetails, including the PasswordEncoder password machine.
17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
    onfigure(HttpSecurity http) configures authorization based on url.

    Authentication verifies if a user is really the user by the correct credentials. Authorization gives the user different privilege to do certain things based on their role
