# HW 14
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. What is the authentication
```
Authentication is the process of verifying a user or device before allowing access to a system or resources.
```

### 3. What is the authorization
```
Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function. 
```

### 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization
```
Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
```

### 5. What is HTTP Session
```
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
```

### 6. What is Cookie
```
A cookie is a piece of data from a website that is stored within a web browser that the website can retrieve at a later time. Cookies are used to tell the server that users have returned to a particular website.
```

### 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie
```
1. Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information, while sessions are server-side files that contain user data.
2. Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user, while the session is over when the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed.
3. Cookie can only store a certain amount of info, while session can hold an indefinite quantity of data.
```

### 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application
```
A session stores the variables and their values within a file in a temporary directory on the server. 
Cookies are stored on the user's computer as a text file.
```

### 9. What is JWT
```
JWT, standing for JSON Web Token, is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
```

### 10. What is the spring security filter?
```
The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it.
```

### 11. describe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
```
1. Post /authenticate with username and password
2. Validate the username and password. Generate the JWT using secret key
3. Return the generated JWT
4. GET /hello with JWT in the Header
5. Validate JWT using secret key
6. Return the response
```

### 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password
Yes, I used Autoencoder to encode password.

### 13. What is UserDetailsService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
```
`UserDetailsService` is used by `DaoAuthenticationProvider` for retrieving a username, a password, and other attributes for authenticating with a username and password. Spring Security provides in-memory and JDBC implementations of `UserDetailsService`

AuthenticationProvider indicates a class can process a specific Authentication implementation.

AuthenticationManager is a static class that manages the authentication modules that an application uses. When a request is made to protected resources, the AuthenticationManager calls the Authenticate method to get an Authorization instance to use in subsequent requests.

AuthenticationFilter is a a component that authenticates an HTTP request.
```

### 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage
```
Disadvantages: 1. Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 2. Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.

Design the session such that the session should stay active as long as the web page is open on the client machine. Even if there are no post backs to reset the session timer. When the web page is closed, the session should time out normally.
```

### 15. how to get value from application.properties
```
We can use the @Value annotation and access the property in whichever Spring bean you're using
```

### 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
```
configure(HttpSecurity http) allows configuration of web based security at a resource level, based on a selection match

configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) is a helper class that eases the set up of UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, and other dependencies to build an AuthenticationManager.
```

### 17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization
```
Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information.
```
