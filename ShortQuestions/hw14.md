### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
See annotations.md

### 2. What is the authentication
Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource

### 3. What is the authorization
Granted authority in spring security is a “permission” or “right” given to a role

### 4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization
Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights

### 5. What is HTTP Session
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application

### 6. What is Cookie
Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network

### 7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie
Cookies are client-side files that are stored on a local computer and contain user information. Sessions are server-side files that store user information.
Cookies expire after the user specified lifetime. The session ends when the user closes the browser or logs out of the program
Cookies can only store a limited amount of data. Session is able to store an unlimited amount of information.

### 8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across  the application
A session stores the variables and their values within a file in a temporary directory on the server. Cookies are stored on the user's computer as a text file

### 9. What is JWT
JWT stands for Json WebToken. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object
### 10. What is the spring security filter?
Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required.
### 11. describe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key.
### 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password
Yes. BCryptPasswordEncoder to encode the Password using Bcrypt algorithm
### 13. What is UserDetailsService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
- UserDetailsService: The UserDetailsService interface is used to retrieve user-related data. It has one method named loadUserByUsername() which can be overridden to customize the process of finding the user.
It is used by the DaoAuthenticationProvider to load details about the user during authentication.
- AuthenticationProvider:  Spring Security provides a variety of options for performing authentication. These options follow a simple contract; an Authentication request is processed by an AuthenticationProvider, and a fully authenticated object with full credentials is returned
- AuthenticationManager: AuthenticationManager is a static class that manages the authentication modules that an application uses
- AuthenticationFilter: An authentication filter is a component that authenticates an HTTP request

### 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage
Disadvantage: Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 2. Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.

How to overcome: Design the session such that the session should stay active as long as the web page is open on the client machine. Even if there are no post backs to reset the session timer. When the web page is closed, the session should time out normally.

### 15. how to get value from application.properties
Use the @Value annotation and access the property in whichever Spring bean you're using
### 16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
- configure(HttpSecurity http): Configure some simple authorization on each URL
- configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configure user details and password encoding when using In-Memory Authentication

### 17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization
An application needs to know who is accessing the application. So authentication is related to word who. Application will check it by a login form. User will enter user name and password and these inputs will be validated by the application. Once the validation is successful, user is declared as authenticated

Authorization is to check whether user can access the application or not or what user can access and what user can not access.
