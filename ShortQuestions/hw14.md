### 1.Can you tell something about docker container?
* Consists of applications and dependencies
* Run as isolated systems in the host operating system with shared resources
* Infrastructure dependency gets removed  while deploying and running applications

### 2. What are docker images
* Executable packages to create containers. Docker images can be deployed to any environment
### 3. What is a DockerFile
* Text file that has all the docker command needed for building image.
### 4. Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?
* Software that makes virtualization happen.
### 5. What can you tell about Docker Compose?
* YAML file consists of details regarding various services, networks and volumes needed for setting up Docker application.
### 6. Can you tell something about docker namespace?
* A namespace is basically a Linux feature that ensures OS resources partition in a mutually exclusive manner. This forms the core concept behind containerization as namespaces introduce a layer of isolation amongst the containers. In docker, the namespaces ensure that the containers are portable and they don't affect the underlying host. Examples for namespace types that are currently being supported by Docker – PID, Mount, User, Network, IPC.
### 7. What is the docker command that lists the status of all docker containers?
``` 
docker ps -a
```
### 8.On what circumstances will you lose data stored in a container?
* When the container is deleted, data gets lost
### 9. What is docker image registry?
* An area where the docker images are stored.
* It can be either private or public and Docker hub is the most popular registry
### 10. How many Docker components are there ?
* Docker Client
* Docker Host
* Docker Registry
### 11. What is a Docker Hub?
* Public cloud-based registry provided by Docker for public images of containers
* Images can be pushed to Docker hub as well by ``` docker push``` command

### 12. What commands can you run to export a docker image as an archive?
``` 
docker save -o <exported_name>.tar <container-name>
```
### 13. What command can be run to import a pre-exported Docker image into another Docker host?
``` 
docker load -i <exported_image_name>.tar
```
### 14. Can a paused container be removed from Docker?
* No. A container must be stopped before being removed
### 15. What command is used to check for the version of docker client?
``` 
docker version
```
or
``` 
docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
```
for only the server detail
### 16. Differentiate between virtualization and containerization
#### Virtualization
* Helps developers to run and host OS on the hardware of a single physical server
* Hypervisors provide overall virtual machines to the guest operating system
* Virtual machines form an abstraction ofo the system hardware layer meaning that each virtual machine on the host acts like a physical machine

#### Containerization
* Helps developers to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on single virtual machine
* Containers ensure isolated environment provided for running the application
* Containers form abstraction of the application layers.
### 17. Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile
* COPY provides the basic support of copying local files into container
* ADD provides additional features like remote URl and tar extraction
### 18. Can a container restart by itself?
* Yes, only while using certain docker-defined policies while using docker command
* Off: Container won't be restarted in case it's stopped or fail
* On-failure: restarts when failures that are not user associated happens
* Unless-stopped: only restart when command is executed to stop by user
* Always: container always gets restarted
### 19. Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer?
* Image: Image is built up from a series of layers of instructions
* Layer: Each layer corresponds to an instruction of the image's Dockerfile

### 20. What is the purpose of the volume parameter in a docker run command?
* The volume parameter is used for syncing a directory of a container with any of the host directories.
```
docker run -v /data/app:usr/src/app myapp
```
### 21. Where are docker volumes stored in docker?
* They are stored in Docker host filesystem at /var/lib/docker/volumes/
### 22. What does the docker info command do?
* The command gets detailed information about Docker installed on the host system.
*  #of container or images, hardware specifications( memory allocated, speed of the processor)

### 23. Can you tell what are the purposes of up, run, and start commands of docker compose?
* Up command starts or restarts all the networks, services and drivers associated with the app
* Run command runs one-off or ad-hoc tasks based on the business requirements.
* Start command only starts those containers already created and stopped.
### 24. What are the basic requirements for the docker to run on any system?
* For Windows, at least Windows 10 64 bit with 2GB RAM
* For Linux, Docker can run on various Linux flavors such as Ubuntu >=12.04
### 25. Can you tell the approach to log in to the docker registry?
* Use 
``` 
docker login 
```
to log in to their own loud repo
### 26. List the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfile?
* FROM is used to set the base image for upcoming instruction
* LABEL is used for the image organization based on projects, modules or licensing.
* RUN is used to execute instructions following it on th top of the current image in a new layer
* CMD is used to provide default values of an executing container.
### 27. Can you differentiate between Daemon Logging and Container Logging?
#### Daemon Level
* Daemon logging has four levels Debug, Info, Error and Fatal
* Debug has the data happened during th execution of the daemon process
* Info carries the information along with the error information
* Errors have those errors that occurred during the execution
* Fatal has the fatal errors that occurred during the exection

#### Container Level
* Container level logging can be done using the command 
``` 
sudo docker run -it <container_name> /bin/bash
```
* To check for the container level logs, run 
``` 
sudo docker logs <container_id>
```

### 28. What is the way to establish communication between docker host and  Linux host?
* It can be done using networking by identifying the "ipconfig" on the docker host. This ensures that an ethernet adapter is created as long as the docker is present in the host.
### 29. What is the best way of deleting a container?
``` 
 docker stop <container_id>
 docker rm <container_id>
```
### 30. Can you tell the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
* CMD command provides executable defaults for an executing container. In case the executable has to be omitted then the usage of ENTRYPOINT instruction along with the JSON array format has to be incorporated.
* ENTRYPOINT specifies that the instruction within it will always be run when the container starts.
  This command provides an option to configure the parameters and the executables. If the DockerFile does not have this command, then it would still get inherited from the base image mentioned in the FROM instruction.
### 31. Can we use JSON instead of YAML while developing docker-compose file in Docker?
Yes.
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up
```
### 32. How many containers you can run in docker and what are the factors influencing this limit?
* There is no clear defined limit but it all depends on the hardware restrictions.
### 33. Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container
* Created: This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
* Running: In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
* Paused: This state happens when the running container has been paused.
* Stopped: This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
* Deleted: In this, the container is in a dead state.
### 34. How to use docker for multiple application environments?
* Docker-compose feature of docker will come to help here. In the docker-compose file, we can define multiple services, networks, and containers along with the volume mapping in a clean manner, and then we can just call the command “docker-compose up”.
* When there are multiple environments involved - it can be either dev, staging, uat, or production servers, we would want to define the server-specific dependencies and processes for running the application. In this case, we can go ahead with creating environment-specific docker-compose files of the name “docker-compose.{environment}.yml” and then based on the environment, we can set up and run the application.

### 35. How will you ensure that a container 1 runs before container 2 while using docker compose?
* The “depends_on” which got added in version 2 of docker-compose can be used as shown in a sample docker-compose.yml file below:

``` 
version: "2.4"
services:
 backend:
   build: .
   depends_on:
     - db
 db:
   image: postgres
```

* The docker-compose up command starts and runs the services in the dependency order specified. For the above example, the DB container is started before the backend.
* docker-compose up SERVICE_NAME by default includes the dependencies associated with the service. In the given example, running docker-compose up backend creates and starts DB (dependency of backend).
* Finally, the command docker-compose stop also stops the services in the order of the dependency specified. For the given example, the backend service is stopped before the DB service.
