## 2 What is the authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. In the context of computer security, authentication typically involves validating the credentials that a user provides, such as a username and password or a digital certificate. The goal of authentication is to ensure that only authorized users are granted access to resources or information.

## 3 What is the authorization?

Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user or system is allowed to perform within a given system or resource. In the context of computer security, authorization is often used in conjunction with authentication, which verifies the identity of a user or system.

## 4 What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

| S.NO | AUTHENTICATION | AUTHORIZATION |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1    | In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system. | While in authorization process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources. |
| 2    | In authentication process, users or persons are verified.    | While in this process, users or persons are validated        |
| 3    | It is done before the authorization process.                 | While this process is done after the authentication process. |
| 4    | It needs usually user’s login details.                       | While it needs user’s privilege or security levels.          |
| 5    | Authentication determines whether the person is user or not. | While it determines What permission do user have?            |
| 6    | Generally, transmit information through an ID Token.         | Generally, transmit information through an Access Token.     |
| 7    | Example : Employees in a company are required to authenticate through the network before accessing their company email. | Example : After an employee successfully authenticates, the system determines what information the employees are allowed to access. |

## 5 What is HTTP Session?

HTTP Session is a mechanism used in web applications to maintain stateful information across multiple HTTP requests and responses. In other words, it allows web servers to remember information about a user's interaction with a web application over a period of time, even as the user navigates between different pages or makes multiple requests.

## 6 What is Cookie? 

A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a website to a user's web browser and stored on the user's device. Cookies are commonly used to store information about a user's preferences or actions on a website, such as login credentials, shopping cart contents, or language preferences.

## 7 What is the difference between Session and Cookie?


|Cookie| Session|
| --- | --- |
| Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information. | Sessions are server-side files that contain user data.       |
| Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user.                 | When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over. |
| It can only store a certain amount of info.                  | It can hold an indefinite quantity of data.                  |
| The browser’s cookies have a maximum capacity of 4 KB.       | We can keep as much data as we like within a session, however there is a maximum memory restriction of 128 MB that a script may consume at one time. |
| Because cookies are kept on the local computer, we don’t need to run a function to start them. | To begin the session, we must use the session start() method. |
| Cookies are not secured.                                     | Session are more secured compare than cookies.               |
| Cookies stored data in text file.                            | Session save data in encrypted form.                         |
| Cookies stored on a limited data.                            | Session stored a unlimited data.                             |
| In PHP, to get the data from Cookies , $_COOKIES the global variable is used | In PHP  , to get the data from Session, $_SESSION the global variable is used |
| We can set an expiration date to delete the cookie’s data. It will automatically delete the data at that specific time. | In PHP, to destroy or remove the data stored within a session, we can use the session_destroy() function, and to unset a specific variable, we can use the unset() function. |

## 8 How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 

Using Session: When a user logs in to a web application, the server can create a session object that is associated with the user's browser using a unique session ID. The server can then store user-specific information, such as username, user ID, and other relevant data, in the session object. This session data can be accessed and modified as the user interacts with the application, and it will persist until the session is closed or times out. To use session in a web application, the developer needs to use session management APIs provided by the web framework or programming language, such as HttpSession in Java Servlet or Flask-Session in Python Flask.

Using Cookie: Cookies can also be used to store user-specific information across the application. When a user logs in, the server can set a cookie in the user's browser containing the user's ID or other relevant data. The browser will then send this cookie back to the server with every subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the user and retrieve any relevant information associated with the cookie. To use cookie in a web application, the developer needs to use cookie management APIs provided by the web framework or programming language, such as Cookie in JavaScript or Response.set_cookie() in Django.

## 9 What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token, which is a compact and self-contained way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs.

## 10 What is the spring security filter?

Spring Security provides a set of filters that can be used to secure web applications. These filters intercept incoming HTTP requests and perform security checks to ensure that the request is authorized.

## 11 Decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)

1. User logs in: When a user logs in to a web application, their credentials are validated by the server. If the credentials are valid, the server creates a JWT for the user.

2. JWT is sent to the client: The server sends the JWT back to the client, which typically stores the token in local storage or a cookie.

3. Client sends JWT in requests: On subsequent requests to the server, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.

4. Server validates JWT: The server receives the JWT in the Authorization header and verifies that the token is valid and has not been tampered with. The server checks the signature of the token to ensure that it has been signed by a trusted source.

5. Server extracts information from JWT: Once the server has validated the JWT, it can extract the information contained in the token's payload, such as the user ID or other relevant data.

6. Access is granted or denied: Based on the information in the JWT, the server determines whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource. If the user is authorized, the server responds with the requested data. If not, the server responds with an error message.


## 12 Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?

BCryptPasswordEncoder， SCryptPasswordEncoder, Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder, and NoOpPasswordEncoder. 



## 13 What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

UserDetailsService: This is an interface used to retrieve user-related data, such as username, password, and authorities. The UserDetailsService is used by the authentication provider to load the user's details during the authentication process.

AuthenticationProvider: This is an interface that defines the contract for authentication providers. Authentication providers are responsible for authenticating a user and providing the user's authorities to Spring Security. The AuthenticationProvider delegates the authentication process to one or more AuthenticationManagers.

AuthenticationManager: This is an interface that is responsible for authenticating a user. AuthenticationManager delegates the authentication request to one or more AuthenticationProviders. AuthenticationManager handles the authentication process, decides whether the authentication was successful or not, and returns an Authentication object if the authentication was successful.

AuthenticationFilter: This is a filter that intercepts incoming requests and checks for the presence of an authentication token. If a token is present, the filter attempts to authenticate the user. If the authentication is successful, the filter allows the request to proceed. If the authentication fails, the filter blocks the request.


## 14 What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

If there are too many session logs, it will consume a lot of memory. Also, to storage session logs in a Redis server will be affected by a single point failure.

To overcome it, we can use JWT instead of session log.


## 15 how to get value from application.properties?

In a Spring Boot application, you can use the @Value annotation to inject values from the application.properties file into your Spring beans. 

## 16 What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

In Spring Security, configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) are two methods that are typically used to configure security for a web application.

configure(HttpSecurity http) is used to configure the security filter chain that is responsible for protecting the application. In this method, you can specify which URLs are allowed or denied, which authentication mechanisms to use, and which authorization rules to apply. 

## 17 What is Spring security authentication and authorization?

In Spring Security, authentication and authorization are typically configured using a combination of configuration classes and annotations. For example, you can use the @EnableWebSecurity annotation to enable security for a web application, and the configure(HttpSecurity http) method to configure the security filter chain that is responsible for protecting the application. You can also use the @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize annotations to specify authorization rules for individual methods or endpoints.
