##3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
####Answer:
    Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP) is one of the key components of Spring framework. AOP is a programming pradigm that aims 
    to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does this by addding additional behavior to exsiting 
    code without modifying the code itself. Instead, we can declare the new code and the new behaviors separately. The Spring AOP 
    helps us implement these cross-cutting concerns.

##4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
####Answer:
    The usage of Spring AOP is logging, tracing, exception handling, and security management.
    Advantages:
    1)AOP is easy to configure.
    2)Spring AOP is implemented in pure java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required,
    3)AOP utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
    4)AOP can create aspects using @AspectJ annotion based or using XML based.
    5)AOP integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.
    Disadvantages:
    1)Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge. 
    2)Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
    3)Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is becasue once a class is marked as an aspect(using XML or annotation),
    Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.

##5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
####Answer:
    Aspect is a class that implements the application concerns that cuts across multiple classes, such as transaction management,
    and logging. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use @Aspect annotation.

##6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
####Answer:
    Pointcut is an expression that is matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be applied or not.

##7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
####Answer:
    Join point is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exexcution.
    In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.

##8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
####Answer:
    Advices are actions that are taken for a particular join point. There are different types of advices, like, before, after 
    and around advice.
    1)Before advice: these advices run before the execution of join point methods. @Before annotation is used to mark a method 
    as before advice.
    2)After returnning advice: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally: for example, if a method returns without
    throwing an exception. @AfterReturning annotation is used to mark a method as after returning advice.
    3)after throwing advice: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception. @AfterThrowing annotation
    marks a method as after throwing advice.
    4)after (finally) advice: An advice that gets executed after the join point method finishes execution, whether normally 
    or by throwing an exception. @After us ysed to create an after advice.
    5)Around advice: This advice surrounds a join point. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and after the method
    invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method 
    execution by returning its own return value or throwing an exception. @Around annotation is used create around advice methods.

##10. When to use Spring Batch?
####Answer:
    Spring batch is applied when the data volumes is quite large. Consider an environment where users have to do a lot of 
    batch processing. This will be quite different from a typical web application which has to work 24/7. But in classic
    environments, it is not unusual to do the heavy lifting, for example, during the night when there are no regular users
    using your system. Batch processing includes typical tasks like reading and writing to files, transforming data, reading
    from or writing to databases, create reports, import and export data and things like that. Often these steps have to ve chained
    together or you have to create more complex workflows where you have to define which jobs can be in parallel or have to be 
    run sequentially etc. That's where a framework like Spring Batch can be very handy.
    Spring Boot Batch provides reusable functions that are essentital in procssing large volumes of records, including logging/
    tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It can also provide
    more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through
    optimization and partitioning technique. High-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner 
    to process sigificant volumes of information.

##11. How Spring Batch works?
####Answer:
    A batch process consists of a Job. This entity excapsulates the entire batch process. A Job can consist of one or more 
    steps. In most cases, one step will read the data through an ItemReaderm process the data using an ItemProcessor, and 
    then write the data through an ItemWriter. JobLacuncher handles starting a job. And finally, JobRespository stores metadata
    about the jobs that are configured and executed.
    1)Step: A step that delegats to a Job to do its work. This is a great tool for managing dependencies between jobs, and 
    also to modularise complex step logic into something that is testable in isolation. The job is executed with parameters 
    that can be extracted from the step execution, hence, this step can also be usefully used as the worker in a parallel or 
    partitioned execution.
    2)ItemReader: Strategy interface for providng the data. Implementations are expected to be stateful and will be called 
    multiple times for each batch, with each call to read() returning a different value and finally returning null when all 
    input data is exhausted. Implementations need not be thread-safe and clients of a ItemReader need to be aware taht this is
    the case. A richer interface, for example, with a look ahead or peek, is not feasible, because we need to support transactions
    in an asynchronous batch.
    3)ItemProcessor: Interface for item transformation. Given an item as input, this interface provides an extension points which 
    allows for the application of business logic in an item oriented processing scenario. It should be noted that while it is 
    possible to return a different type than the one provided, it is not strictly necessary. Furthermore, returning null indicates
    that the item should not be continued to be processed.
    4)ItemStreamWriter: Basic interface for generic output operations. Class implementing this interface will be responsible for 
    serializing objects as necessary. Generally, it is responsibility of implementing class to decide which technology to use
    for mapping and how it should be configured. The write method is responsible for making sure that any internal buffers
    are flushed. If a transaction is active, it will also usually be necessary to discard the output on a subsequent rollback.
    The resource to which the wirter is sending data shold normally be able to handle this itself.

##12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
####Answer:
    A Spring Batch job can be scheduled using Cron Job. Spring Batch jobs can be executed periodically on a fixed shedule
    using some cron expressions that are passed to Spring TaskScheduler. Cron expressions in scheduling are used to represent
    the details of the schedule. Spring Batch jobs can be configured in two ways, one way is using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
    The other method is creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job
    execution logic inside this method.

##13. What is the cron expression?
####Answer:
    Cron expression are used to configure instance of CronTrigger, a subclass of org.quartz.Trigger. A cron expression is a string 
    consisting of six or seven subexpressions(fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. These fields, separated by
    white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that filed.
    The fields include Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Day of month, Month, Day of week, Year.


##14. What is the spring task?
####Answer:
    Spring Task is a lightweighted timing task tool independently developed by Spring. Compared with Quartz, spring task 
    is simpler and more convenient and can be used without introducing other dependencies.
    It basically satisfies normal timed task scenario. To use it, firstly to create a new configuration class, SpringTaskConfig,
    and add @EnableScheduling annotation to start the Spring task. Also, you can add the @EnableScheduling annotation to the main
    class without creating a new configuration class. Then, create a scheduled task class CronTask and use the @Scheduled annotation
    to register the Cron expression to execute the scheduled task.

##15. When to use Spring task?
####Answer:
    Spring task is used to implement scheduled tasks. The scenarios include data backup, time crawl data, pushing information 
    regularly, publishing articles regularly, canceling the order automatically if not paid, and etc..

##16. What is Filter and any filter example?
####Answer:
    1)Filter does filtration when there are a bunch of requests, only the expected requests come in. The filter is preprocessed 
    after the request enters the container, but before it enters the Servlet. The filter can be used to filter some sensitive 
    vocabulary to prevent sql injection, set character encoding, implement URL level permission access control, and compress 
    response information. Also, there can be many filters, and the combination of each filter forms a FilterChain.
    2)for example,
    With @WebFilter, there are filters used for filtering requests, characterencoding, and login.
    CorsFilter can be used for cross-domain.

##17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
####Answer:
    1)The Interceptor wants to interfere with the expected request. The interceptor preprocesses the request before it enters
    the Controller.
    2)The usages of interceptor are as following:
    1.Login Authentication: determine whether the expected user logs in
    2.Permission Verification: checks whether a user has permission to access resources, for example, verifying a token.
    3.Log Records: record operation logs, such as user ip addresses and access time to collect traffic volume statistics.
    4.Handle cookies, localization, internationalization, theme, etc..
    5.Permance Monitoring: monitor request processing time, etc..

##18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
####Answer:
    An interceptor must implement the HandlerInterceptor interface. The preHandle method is executed before the Controller 
    method is called. While the postHandle method is executed after the Controller method returns normally without exception.

##19. What is Swagger?
####Answer:
    Swagger is a set of open source tools built on the OpenAPI specfication, using RestAPI. Using swagger means storing relevant
    information in a description file it defines in yaml or json format. And then maintaining this description file to update 
    the interface documentation, and generate each side code. The swagger consists of three main parts.
    1)Swagger Editor: A browser-based editor that we can use to write our OpenAPI specifications(yaml or json configurations)
    2)Swagger UI: it will render the OpenAPI specification we wrote as an interactive API document, and later we can use a 
    browser to view and mannipulate the RestAPI.
    3)Swagger Codegen: It can simplify the build process by generating server stubs and client SDK through any API defined by
    the OpenApi specification.
    The characteristics of Swagger are as following:
    1)When code changes, the documentation changes accordingly.
    2)It is cross-language, so it can support a variety of languages.
    3)Swagger-UI presents an interactive API document, where you can try API calls drectly from the documentation page.
    4)Document specifications can be imported into related tools like Postman, soapui that will automatically create automated
    tests for us.
