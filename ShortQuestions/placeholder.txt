9. Maven is used for java-based projects, helping to download dependencies.
10. The default maven's lifecycle consists of 8 major steps:Validate, Compile, Test, Package, Integration test, Verify, Install and Deploy.
Validate: This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example â€“ It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.
Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.
Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Integration test: It runs the integration tests for the project.
Verify: This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.
Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.

11. Package is the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Install is to install the packaged code to the local Maven repository.

12. Plugins are the central feature of Maven that allow for the reuse of common build logic across multiple projects, such as clean, compiler, jar, war, javadoc.
