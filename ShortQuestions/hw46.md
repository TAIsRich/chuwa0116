## 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
## 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:

- It is easy to configure.
- Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
- It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
- Can create aspects using @AspectJ annotation based or using XML based.
- It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.

Disadvantages:

- Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
- Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
- Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.


## 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
- An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

## 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
- Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.


## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
- A Joinpoint is a point in Spring AOP during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception, etc. This symbolizes a point in your web application where you can easily plug in the AOP aspect of your software. In Spring AOP, a JoinPoint always represents a method execution.

## 8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
- Advices are actions that are taken for a particular join point. There are different types of advices, like, before, after and around advice.

## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
- You can use Spring Batch in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) and complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on). High-volume batch jobs can use the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

## 11. How Spring Batch works?
- ItemReader: The first step is to read data from a data source, such as a file, database, or message queue. Spring Batch provides several implementations of the ItemReader interface that can be used to read data from various sources.

- ItemProcessor: Once the data is read, it can be processed using one or more ItemProcessor implementations. An ItemProcessor takes an input item, performs some transformation on it, and returns a new item.

- ItemWriter: The processed data is then written to a target data source, such as a file or database, using an implementation of the ItemWriter interface. Spring Batch provides several ItemWriter implementations that can be used to write data to various sources.

- JobExecution: The entire process is managed by a JobExecution, which represents a single execution of a job. The JobExecution keeps track of the status of the job and any errors or exceptions that occur during the processing.

- StepExecution: Each step of the job is represented by a StepExecution, which keeps track of the status of the step and any errors or exceptions that occur during the processing.

- JobRepository: The status of the job and its steps are stored in a JobRepository, which is responsible for managing the metadata associated with the job.

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

## 13. What is the cron expression?
- A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven fields, separated by spaces or tabs, that represent individual values for the second, minute, hour, day of the month, month, day of the week, and (optionally) year. It is used to define the schedule of a recurring job in the Spring Scheduler, and it allows you to specify the exact times at which the job should run.

## 14. What is the spring task?
- SpringTask is a lightweight timing task tool independently developed by Spring, which is simpler and more convenient than Quartz, and can be used without introducing other dependencies. Just add a @EnableScheduling annotation to the configuration class to enable SpringTask's scheduled task capability.

## 15. When to use Spring task? 
When we need to schedule tasks or jobs to run at a specific time or at regular intervals within a Spring application context. For example:

- Running batch jobs
- Performing maintenance tasks
- Running background tasks
- Performing system health checks

## 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
- A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (a servlet or static content), or on the response from a resource, or both.

- Some of the common use cases of filters are：

    - Logging requests and response

    - Logging request processing time
    - Formatting of request body or header
    - Verifying authentication tokens
    - Compressing response
    - Performing Image conversions

## 17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
- In a Spring MVC application, an interceptor is a component that intercepts requests and responses before and after they are handled by a controller. 

- Interceptors can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, performance monitoring, or modifying the model object before rendering a view.
## 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
- preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. This method should return true to return the response to the client.

- postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.
## 19. What is Swagger?
- Swagger is a set of open-source tools for writing REST-based APIs. It simplifies the process of writing APIs starkly, specifying the standards and providing the tools required to write robust, secure, performant and scalable APIs.
