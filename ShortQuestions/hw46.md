## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
- Aspect-oriented programming is a technique for building common, reusable routines that can be applied applicationwide. During development this facilitates separation of core application logic and common, repeatable tasks (input validation, logging, error handling, etc.).
## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- See http://infinitereusablecomponents.blogspot.com/2013/06/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-spring.html
## 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
- Aspect: An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.
## 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
- Pointcut: Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.
## 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
- A Joinpoint is a point in Spring AOP during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception, etc. This symbolizes a point in your web application where you can easily plug in the AOP aspect of your software. In Spring AOP, a JoinPoint always represents a method execution.
## 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
- In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method. Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application.
## 10. When to use Spring Batch?
- You can use Spring Batch in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) and complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on).
## 11.How Spring Batch works?
- Spring Batch follows the traditional batch architecture where a job repository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job. A job can have more than one step. And every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.
## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
- Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
- Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method.
## 13.What is the cron expression?
- The cron command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs(commands or shell scripts), also known as cron jobs, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.
## 14.What is the spring task?
- Spring task scheduling for a task/job is a time based scheduled process which runs automatically as per the configuration supplied. Once scheduling is enabled in application, a scheduled task can execute automatically in Spring application.
## 15.When to use Spring task?
- To schedule a job in a specific time to execute
## 16.What is Filter and any filter example?
- A filter is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and postprocessing of a request. It is mainly used to perform filtering tasks such as conversion, logging, compression, encryption and decryption, input validation etc.
## 17.What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
- An HTTP interceptor is an Angular service that intercepts HTTP requests and responses generated by the built-in HTTP client of the Angular framework. By using an interceptor to change HTTP requests and answers in a single area, we may avoid redundant code and make our code more intelligible.
## 18.In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
- prehandle() – called before the execution of the actual handler. 
- postHandle() – called after the handler is executed.
## 19.What is Swagger?
- Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. Why is it so great? Well, by reading your API's structure, we can automatically build beautiful and interactive API documentation.
