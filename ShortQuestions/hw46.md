\3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program.

\4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

​		Advantage

- It uses Spring's IOC for dependency injection

- Easy to maintain and make changes to the aspects

- Allows the developer to concentrate on the business code, instead the cross cutting concerns.

  Disadvantage

- Methods with protected, private or default visibility will not be advised.

- A little difficult to debug the AOP based application code.

\5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.

\6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not.

\7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

Joinpoint are points in your program execution where flow of execution got changed like Exception catching, Calling other method.

\8.  What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application.
\10. When to use Spring Batch?

You can use Spring Batch in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) and complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on). High-volume batch jobs can use the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

\11. How Spring Batch works?

Spring Batch is a good choice for processing large volumes of data in batch mode, where robustness and reliability are important, and customization is required. It is well-suited for use cases such as data migration, report generation, and end-of-day processing.

\12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

Have a class SpringBatchScheduler to configure scheduling and batch job. A method launchJob() will be registered as a scheduled task.

\13. What is the cron expression?

cron is a basic utility available on Unix-based systems. It enables users to schedule tasks to run periodically at a specified date/time.

\14. What is the spring task?

Spring task scheduling for a task/job is a time based scheduled process which runs automatically as per the configuration supplied.

\15. When to use Spring task?

Some examples of tasks that you can use the Task Scheduler to execute are: starting an application; sending an email message 

\16. What is Filter and any filter example?

In Java, a Filter is a component that intercepts and processes requests and responses in a web application. It is part of the Java Servlet specification and is used to perform tasks such as logging, security, compression, and content modification.

Reading the remote host and remote address from the ServletRequest object before sending the request to the controller.

\17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

Spring Interceptor are used to intercept client requests and process them. Sometimes we want to intercept the HTTP Request and do some processing before handing it over to the controller handler methods.

\18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

preHandle is used to intercept the request before it’s handed over to the handler method. This method should return ‘true’ to let Spring know to process the request through another spring interceptor or to send it to handler method if there are no further spring interceptors.

postHandle is called when HandlerAdapter has invoked the handler but DispatcherServlet is yet to render the view.

\19. What is Swagger?

Swagger is an open source pro ject used to generate the REST API documents for RESTful web services. It provides a user interface to access our RESTful web services via the web browser.
