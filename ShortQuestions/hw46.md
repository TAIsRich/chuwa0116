3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns in a software system.

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

Advantages

- It can separate some oridinary logic from the main service logic. Made the code more modular and easier to understand.
- Aspect can be reused in multiple methods.

Disadvantages

- It became harder to debug the code.
- Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
- Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.
- AOP can introduce additional performance overhead due to the additional processing required to apply aspects to the code.

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?

An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. A standard class tagged with the @Aspect annotation can be used to implement an aspect.

6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?

A pointcut is an expression that chooses one or more join points at which advice is given. Pointcuts can be defined using expressions or patterns. It supports a number of expressions that correspond to the join points.

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?

A join point is a place in the application where an AOP aspect is applied. It could also be a specific advice execution instance. A join point in AOP can be a method execution, exception handling, changing the value of an object variable, and so on.

8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?

The advice is an action which we take before or after the method execution. In the Spring AOP framework, there are five types of advice: before, after, after-returning, after-throwing, and around advice. Advice is taken at a specific join point.

10. When to use Spring Batch?
Generally when you want to do things not related to real time process. Such as data transformation, data integratation, data analyze.

11. How Spring Batch works?

It mainly contains Job management, Reader, Writer, Processor. So you should first create a Configure class to implement reader, process and writer method. After that, you will write the step method and excute it.

12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

To schedule a Spring Batch job, you can use the built-in scheduling capabilities provided by Spring Framework. Here are the steps you can follow:

- Add the Spring Batch and Spring Scheduler dependencies to your project.
- Create a Spring Batch job by defining a Job instance, which includes a set of Step instances that define the work to be done.
- Create a SchedulerFactoryBean bean in your Spring configuration file and set its properties to define the scheduling details, such as the start time, end time, and frequency of the job.

13. What is the cron expression?

A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven fields, separated by spaces or tabs, that represent individual values for the second, minute, hour, day of the month, month, day of the week, and (optionally) year. It is used to define the schedule of a recurring job in the Spring Scheduler, and it allows you to specify the exact times at which the job should run.

You can also use special characters to define specific ranges of values, such as "-" to indicate a range of values, "," to specify multiple values, and "/" to specify increments. For example, "0 0 12-18 ? * MON-FRI" means "every weekday between 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM".

14. What is the spring task?

Spring Task is a feature of the Spring Framework that allows you to schedule tasks or jobs to run at a specific time or at regular intervals. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for scheduling tasks within a Spring application context.

Spring Task is built on top of the Java Executor framework and provides a way to execute tasks in a separate thread pool. This ensures that the main thread of the application is not blocked while the task is being executed. The task can be a simple method call or a complex job that requires more processing.

15. When to use Spring task?

You can use Spring Task when you need to schedule tasks or jobs to run at a specific time or at regular intervals within a Spring application context. Here are some examples of when you might want to use Spring Task:

- Running batch jobs: Spring Task is ideal for running batch jobs that need to be executed at a specific time or at regular intervals, such as generating reports or processing data.
- Sending emails: If your application needs to send out emails at specific times or intervals, Spring Task can be used to schedule the sending of these emails.

16. What is Filter and any filter example?

In web development, a filter is a component that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses in a web application. Filters are used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and data compression, and they can be applied to any servlet or JSP in a web application.

Filters are implemented as Java classes that implement the javax.servlet.Filter interface, and they can be configured in the web.xml deployment descriptor file of a web application.

17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?


In Spring MVC, an interceptor is a mechanism that allows developers to intercept and handle requests and responses that flow through the DispatcherServlet. Interceptors can be used to perform common pre-processing and post-processing tasks on requests and responses, such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

preHandle() and postHandle() are two important methods in the Spring MVC Interceptor interface. preHandle() allows developers to perform pre-processing tasks on requests, while postHandle() allows them to perform post-processing tasks on responses. Together, these methods provide a powerful mechanism for intercepting and handling requests and responses in a Spring MVC application.

19. What is Swagger?


Swagger is an open-source software framework that allows developers to document, design, and consume RESTful web services. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.
