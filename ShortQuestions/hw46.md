## 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
## 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:

- It is easy to configure.
- Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
- It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
- Can create aspects using @AspectJ annotation based or using XML based.
- It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.

Disadvantages:

- Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
- Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
- Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.


## 5.  What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
- An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

## 6.  What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
- Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.
