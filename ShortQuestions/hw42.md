## 1.List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
- See annotations.md
## 2.Type the Comment feature for the class project.
## 3.In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.
## 4.what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
- A JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification of Java which is used to access, manage, and persist data between Java object and relational database. It is considered as a standard approach for Object Relational Mapping. JPA can be seen as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems. Being a specification, JPA doesn't perform any operation by itself. Thus, it requires implementation. So, ORM tools like Hibernate, TopLink, and iBatis implements JPA specifications for data persistence.
- A Hibernate is a Java framework which is used to store the Java objects in the relational database system. It is an open-source, lightweight, ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. So, it follows the common standards provided by the JPA.
## 5.What is Hikari? what is the benefits of connection pool?
- Hikari is a JDBC DataSource implementation that provides a connection pooling mechanism. Compared to other implementations, it promises to be lightweight and better performing.
- Connection pools promote the reuse of connection objects and reduce the number of times that connection objects are created. Connection pools significantly improve performance for database-intensive applications because creating connection objects is costly both in terms of time and resources.
## 6.What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
-@OneToMany define a one-to-many relationship between two entities. Where one entity has relationship with many other entity. For example one post can have many comments.
-@ManyToOne define a many-to-one relationship between two entities. For example many people live in the same building
-@ManyToMany define a many-to-many relationship between two entities. For example Your Order table contains orders placed by multiple customers (who are listed in the Customers table), and a customer may place more than one order.
## 7.What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
- cascade = CascadeType.ALL: This parameter is used to specify that changes made to the parent entity should be cascaded to its related entities.

- orphanRemoval = true: This parameter is used to specify that when a parent entity is removed, any related entities that no longer have a parent should be removed as well.

- CascadeType.PERSIST: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is persisted.

- CascadeType.MERGE: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is merged.

- CascadeType.REFRESH: The state of the parent entity will be refreshed in its related entities when the parent is refreshed.

- CascadeType.REMOVE: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is removed.

- CascadeType.DETACH: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is detached.

## 8.What is SessionFactory and Session?
- The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database.

## 9.What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
- The JPA default table name is the name of the class (minus the package) with the first letter capitalized. Each attribute of the class will be stored in a column in the table.
- For example, if you have an entity class called Student, the default table name would be STUDENT. You can also specify a different table name using the @Table annotation.
## 3. What is JPQL?
- The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is the query language defined by JPA. JPQL is similar to SQL, but operates on objects, attributes and relationships instead of tables and columns. JPQL can be used for reading (SELECT), as well as bulk updates (UPDATE) and deletes (DELETE).
## 4.What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
- @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.
- @NamedQueries annotation is placed on the JPA entity class and contains an array of NamedQuery annotations.
## 5.What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
- If we use @Query, the method name can violate the JPA naming convention, but it's still better to have a method name that is easily understood for the purpose of the method.
## 6.  What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
- HQL is to perform both select and non-select operations on the data, but Criteria is only for selecting the data, we cannot perform non-select operations using criteria. HQL is suitable for executing Static Queries, where as Criteria is suitable for executing Dynamic Queries.
## 7. What is EntityManager?
- The EntityManager is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit. Each EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context.
## 8.  What is SessionFactory and Session?
- The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application. A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database.
## 9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
- A transaction is a unit of work that is executed against a database, and consists of a series of database operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit. In other words, either all the operations in a transaction are executed, or none of them are. The purpose of a transaction is to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even if an error occurs during the execution of the operations.
- We can use try catch and rollback to accomplish it.
## 10. What is hibernate Caching?
- Hibernate caching acts as a layer between the actual database and your application. It reduces the time taken to obtain the required data â€” as it fetches from memory instead of directly hitting the database. It is very useful when you need to fetch the same kind of data multiple times.
## 11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
- The first level cache is associated with the Session Object, while the second-level cache is associated with the SessionFactory object. This means first-level cache's scope is limited to session-level while second-level cache's scope is at the application level.
