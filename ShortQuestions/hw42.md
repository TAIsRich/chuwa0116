#  Part 1
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2. Type the Comment feature for the class project.
### 3. In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.
### 4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate? 
* JPA is a standard of Object Relational Mapping. It is an interface that defines a set of annotations for creating the object relational mapping.
* Hibernate is an open source object relational mapping (ORM) tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications.
### 5.  What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
* Hikari is a high-performance, production-ready JDBC connection pool implementation for Java applications.
* A connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained so that the re-creation of connections can be avoided, thus improving performance and scalability.
### 6. What is the @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
* @OneToMany define a one to many relationship between two entities. Where one entity has relationship with many other entity. For example one post can have many comments.
* @ManyToOne define a many to one relationship between two entities. For example one comment can only belong to one post.
* @ManyToMany define a many to many relationship between two entities. For example one student can enroll many courses. One course can be selected by many students.
### 7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
* `cascade = CascadeType.ALL`: This parameter is used to specify that changes made to the parent entity should be cascaded to its related entities.
* `orphanRemoval = true`: This parameter is used to specify that when a parent entity is removed, any related entities that no longer have a parent should be removed as well. 
-   `CascadeType.PERSIST`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is persisted.  
-   `CascadeType.MERGE`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is merged.
-   `CascadeType.REFRESH`: The state of the parent entity will be refreshed in its related entities when the parent is refreshed. 
-   `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is removed.   
-   `CascadeType.DETACH`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is detached.
### 8. What is the fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
There are two ways in which data is loaded: eager and lazy. Eager fetch means that when a record is fetched from the database, all the associated records from related tables are also fetched. So if we fetch a tournament record, all the registrations for the tournament are also fetched.

Eager fetch is the default fetch type used by Hibernate but it is not always the most efficient. Lazy fetch on the other hand, fetches the records only when they are needed.

If you have large relationships and only need to access the related entities occasionally, you should use `FetchType.LAZY`. If you always need to access the related entities and want to avoid the overhead of multiple database round trips, you should use `FetchType.EAGER`.
### 9.What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
* You should use the name already in Database. For example, findByLastNameAndFirstName(); we should have lastName and firstName in our database.
* No, we don't need, only declare it is enough.
### 10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer, you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.

# part 2
### 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2.  type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw05_01_slides_JPQL.
### 3.  What is JPQL?
 * Java Persistence Query language.It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database.
### 4.  What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
* The `@NamedQuery` is a JPA annotation that allows you to define a named query directly in your JPA entity class. Named queries are pre-defined, reusable JPQL or SQL queries that can be used throughout your application.
* The `NamedQueries` annotation is placed on the JPA entity class and contains an array of `NamedQuery` annotations.
###  5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
If we use `@Query`, the method name can violate the JPA naming convention, but it's still better to have a method name that is easily understood for the purpose of the method.
### 6.  What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
* HQL is a powerful query language that provides a way to perform complex database queries using a SQL-like syntax. HQL is specific to the Hibernate framework, which is one of the popular implementations of JPA.
* Criteria Queries: Criteria Queries is a type-safe, programmatic approach to creating database queries in JPA.
### 7. What is EnityManager?
A JPA EntityManager manages connection to a database as well as to database operations. EntityManager is associated with a PersistenceContext . All operations that are performed in a specific session are stored inside the PersistenceContext.
EntityManager is the interface to the Persistence Context . All operations on the entity go through the EntityManager . We will declare an EntityManager object in our class and mark it with the @PersistenceContext annotation.
### 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
* SessionFactory is an interface available in org.hibernate package and it provides factory methods to get session object.
* Session is an interface available in org.hibernate package which provides different API to communicate java application to hibernate.
### 9.  What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
* A transaction is a unit of work that is executed against a database. Transactions ensure that either all or none of the changes made to the database are committed, providing atomicity, consistency, and durability (ACID) guarantees.
* We can use try catch and rollback to accomplish it.
### 10. What is hibernate Caching?
It is between database and application. it can reduce query fired in the database.
### 11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
first level stays in session level.
second level allow cross session use.
