### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

### 2. Type the Comment feature for the class project.

### 3. In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.

### 4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?

- JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects/classes and a relational database. It provides a standard set of APIs for interacting with a database, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required and improving the maintainability of applications.
- Hibernate is a popular, open-source, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that provides a mechanism to map Java objects to relational database tables. It implements the JPA specification and provides additional features beyond the standard JPA specification. With Hibernate, you can write Java code to interact with your database using simple Java objects, without having to write any SQL code. Hibernate takes care of generating the necessary SQL statements to perform operations such as inserting, updating, and retrieving data from the database.

### 5. What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?

- Hikari is a high-performance, production-ready JDBC connection pool implementation for Java applications.
- A connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained so that the re-establishment of a connection to the database is avoided. A connection pool is used to manage a collection of database connections to reduce the overhead of establishing a new connection for every user request or database transaction.

### 6. What is the @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.

- @OneToMany define a one to many relationship between two entities. Where one entity has relationship with many other entity. For example one post can have many comments.
- @ManyToOne define a many to one relationship between two entities. For example one comment can only belong to one post.
- @ManyToMany define a many to many relationship between two entities. For example one student can enroll many courses. One course can be selected by many students.

### 7. What is the cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?

- `cascade = CascadeType.ALL`: This parameter is used to specify that changes made to the parent entity should be cascaded to its related entities.
- `orphanRemoval = true`: This parameter is used to specify that when a parent entity is removed, any related entities that no longer have a parent should be removed as well.

- `CascadeType.PERSIST`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is persisted.
- `CascadeType.MERGE`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is merged.
- `CascadeType.REFRESH`: The state of the parent entity will be refreshed in its related entities when the parent is refreshed.
- `CascadeType.REMOVE`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is removed.
- `CascadeType.DETACH`: Changes to the parent entity will be cascaded to its related entities when the parent is detached.

### 8. What is the fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?

`FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` are the two fetch types in JPA that control the behavior of data retrieval from the database.

`FetchType.LAZY` means that the data is fetched only when it is first accessed. This approach is useful when dealing with large data sets, as it allows you to defer loading of data until it is actually needed, which can improve performance.

`FetchType.EAGER` means that the data is fetched immediately when the parent entity is loaded. This approach is useful when you always need the data to be available, as it ensures that the data is loaded and available as soon as the parent entity is loaded.

The choice between `FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` depends on the use case. If the related data is rarely accessed, it's better to use `FetchType.LAZY` to avoid the overhead of fetching the data when it's not needed. If the related data is always needed, `FetchType.EAGER` is a good choice to ensure that the data is available as soon as the parent entity is loaded.

In general, it's a good idea to use `FetchType.LAZY` when dealing with large data sets and `FetchType.EAGER` when the data is always needed. However, the choice between `FetchType.LAZY` and `FetchType.EAGER` depends on the specific requirements of the application and should be made based on performance and data retrieval needs.

### 9.What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?

JPA has a set of naming conventions that you can use to define your database tables and columns. The naming conventions are used by JPA to map Java objects to database tables and columns.

Examples: 

1. Table Naming: The default table name is the name of the entity class. For example, if you have an entity class called `Person`, the default table name would be `PERSON`. You can also specify a different table name using the `@Table` annotation.

### 3. What is JPQL?

- JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is a query language that is used to interact with relational databases in a Java environment. It's a string-based language that provides a way to query data stored in relational databases using a syntax that is similar to SQL, but is designed to be more object-oriented. JPQL is part of the Java Persistence API (JPA), which is a Java EE standard for managing relational data in Java applications. JPQL can be used to perform various operations such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT statements, as well as to define complex query expressions and join multiple tables. The main advantage of using JPQL over SQL is that JPQL uses a Java-based syntax that is more natural to Java developers, and provides a way to interact with relational data in an object-oriented way.

### 4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?

- The `@NamedQuery` is a JPA annotation that allows you to define a named query directly in your JPA entity class. Named queries are pre-defined, reusable JPQL or SQL queries that can be used throughout your application.
- The `NamedQueries` annotation is placed on the JPA entity class and contains an array of `NamedQuery` annotations.

### 5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?

If we use `@Query`, the method name can violate the JPA naming convention, but it's still better to have a method name that is easily understood for the purpose of the method.

### 6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?

- HQL is a powerful query language that provides a way to perform complex database queries using a SQL-like syntax. HQL is specific to the Hibernate framework, which is one of the popular implementations of JPA.
- Criteria Queries: Criteria Queries is a type-safe, programmatic approach to creating database queries in JPA.

### 7. What is EnityManager?

The EntityManager is a central component of the Java Persistence API (JPA) and is responsible for managing the persistence of entities in a Java application. It provides a way to interact with relational data stored in a database, allowing you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities, as well as executing JPQL queries.

### 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?

- The SessionFactory is a factory object that is used to create Session objects in Hibernate. It is a heavy-weight object that is typically created once during application initialization and is used to create Session objects throughout the lifetime of the application. The SessionFactory is responsible for creating and managing the database connection, and for caching data that has been loaded from the database. It also provides a way to define mappings between the Java objects and the database tables.
- A Session is a light-weight object that represents a single unit of work with the database. A Session is created from a SessionFactory and is used to perform various database operations, such as saving and retrieving objects, executing queries, and managing transactions. 

### 9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?

- A transaction is a unit of work that is executed against a database, and consists of a series of database operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit. In other words, either all the operations in a transaction are executed, or none of them are. The purpose of a transaction is to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even if an error occurs during the execution of the operations.
- We can use try catch and rollback to accomplish it.

### 10. What is hibernate Caching?

It is between database and application. it can reduce query fired in the database.

### 11. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?

first level stays in session level. second level allow cross session use.
