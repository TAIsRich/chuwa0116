### 10  What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details 

1. **Validate:** This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example â€“ It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.
2. **Compile:** It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.
3. **Test:** It runs unit tests for the project.
4. **Package:** This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
5. **Integration test:** It runs the integration tests for the project.
6. **Verify:** This step runs checks to verify that the project is valid and meets the quality standards.
7. **Install:** This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
8. **Deploy:** It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.

### 11  what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle ?

Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.

Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.

### 12 What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.

Plugins are the central feature of Maven that allow for the reuse of common build logic across multiple projects. They do this by executing an "action" (i.e. creating a WAR file or compiling unit tests) in the context of a project's description - the Project Object Model (POM).

Example: `clean`, `complier`, `deploy`, `failsafe`
