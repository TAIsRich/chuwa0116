#### 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
* @Configuration表示StorageConfiguration也是一个Spring管理的Bean，可直接注入到其他Bean中：
* @Configuration indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions. 
* The @Bean annotation tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context.

#### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

- Global Exception Handler
- HandlerExceptionResolver

#### 5. What is the actuator?
- Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of the Spring Boot Framework. It uses HTTP endpoints to expose operational information about any running application.


### hw43-Spring-Basic
#### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
- As an extension of the Spring Framework, Spring Boot is widely used to make development on Spring faster, more efficient, and convenient

#### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
- Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework
- The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.

#### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
- The @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify packages to locate components in Spring

#### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
- pom

#### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
- Spring Boot SpringApplication class is used to bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main method

#### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
- There are three different ways in which you can define a Spring bean: 
- annotating your class with the stereotype @Component annotation (or its derivatives) writing a bean factory method 
- annotated with the @Bean annotation in a custom Java configuration class. 
- declaring a bean definition in an XML configuration file.

#### 8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
- The default bean name will be method name. It means first bean name is getBeanA and second bean name is getBeanB

#### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
- @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. 
- @Service annotates classes at the service layer. 
- @Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
 
#### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
- The injection in Spring is either done via setter, field or constructor injection. Classes which are managed by Spring DI must conform to the Java bean standard. In the context of Spring classes are also referred to as beans or as spring beans.

#### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
- Constructor Injection (also known as Type 3), 
- Setter Injection (also known as Type 2), 
- and Interface Injection (also known as Type 1).
- Constructor-based dependency injection is certainly considered a best practice.

#### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
- annotate the object generating method in the @Configuration class with @Primary
- If there is no primary, use @Qualifier

#### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
- BeanFactory loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup.

#### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
- A bean's scope refers to the lifecycle of the bean; things like how long the bean will live, how many instances will be created, and how the bean is shared in the Spring environment. The default scope for the bean is a singleton, like the example below, in which we haven't explicitly given a scope

#### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
