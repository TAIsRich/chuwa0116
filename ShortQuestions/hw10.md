### Homework 10

Name: Zijun Zhou

##### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
The annotations.md is updated as needed.

##### 2. Type the Comment feature for the class project.
The code is included in /MavenProject

##### 3. In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.

##### 4. what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
JPA stands for the Java Persistence API, and it's only a specification, not an implementation. Actually, it's observed as a standard technique for Object Relational Mapping. Hibernate on the other hand, is the contributor and implementation for JPA specifications. It's a Object Relational Mapping framework that could map Java data type to a SQL data type.

##### 5. What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
Hiraki is a high-performance JDBC connection pool. As is known to people, it would be very expensive to initialize a new connection pool each time, therefore, Hiraki Pool is actually the cache of database connections maintained so that the connections could be reused when future requests to the databases are required, which could significantly reduce the overall resource usage.

##### 6. What is the  `@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany`? write some examples.
These are the annotations that hint the JPA ORM frameworks the relation between different classes. @OneToMany means that an object has owned many relevant objects, for example, a user could have multiple accounts. @ManyToOne is the opposite relation of @OneToMany, for example, different accounts could have only one owner. @ManyToMany means that an object may have multiple associated objects, however, the associated objects could also have relevant original objects. For example, a teacher could teach multiple classes, however, a class could also have multiple teachers. And if we fill in the name of the column of the associated objects' primary key, the JPA framework would help us not only query the original objects, but also those associated objects.

##### 7. What is the  `cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true?` and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
The cascade attribute is set to CascadeType.ALL, meaning that all the JPA and Hibernate entity state transitions (e.g., persist, merge, remove) are passed from the parent entity to the child entities.
The orphanRemoval attribute is going to instruct the JPA provider to trigger a remove entity state transition when a child entity is no longer referenced by its parent entity.
**Other CascadeType:**
CascadeType.Persist: Owning entity saved, then related entity saved
CascadeType.Merge: Owning entity merged, then related entity merged
CascadeType.Refresh: Owning entity refreshed, then related entity refreshed
CascadeType.Remove: Owning entity removed, then related entity removed
CascadeType.Detach: Owning entity manually detached, then related entity detached

##### 8. What is the  `fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER?` what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
Eager fetch means that when a record is fetched from the database, all the 
associated records from related tables are also fetched. Lazy fetch on the other hand, fetches the records only when they are needed.
When I need both parent entities and their children entities information, I would use fetch = FetchType.EAGER. However, if I only use the parent entities' information, I would choose fetch = FetchType.LAZY

##### 9. What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?
JPA would help us implement the methods by the method name we have declared. Therefore, we do not need to implement the methods ourselves.
The examples are as follows:
- findByUsername: the JPA frameworks would help us find the records whose username is passed by the method parameter

- findByAgeIn(int[]):Actually, the frameworks would help us find the records whose age is in the range we specify by using the integer array


##### 10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer, you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.
The code is included in /MavenProject.
