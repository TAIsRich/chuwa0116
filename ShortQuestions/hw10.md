## 2.  Type the Comment feature for the class project.

- 

## 3.  In postman, call of the APIs in PostController and CommentController.

## 4.  what is JPA? and what is Hibernate?
- JPA is a Java specification that gives some functionality and standard to ORM tools. It is used to examine, control, and persist data between Java objects and relational databases

- Hibernate is an open source object relational mapping (ORM) tool that provides a framework to map object-oriented domain models to relational databases for web applications

## 5.  What is Hiraki? what is the benefits of connection pool?
- Hikari is a JDBC DataSource implementation that provides a connection pooling mechanism
- Connection pools promote the reuse of connection objects and reduce the number of times that connection objects are created. Connection pools significantly improve performance for database-intensive applications because creating connection objects is costly both in terms of time and resources.

## 6.  What is the  @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany? write some examples.
- @OneToMany means one row in a table can map to many rows from others.
    Eg, companyId maps to many employeeId

- @ManyToOne means many rows in a table can map to one row from others.
    eg. many studentId map to one departmentId

- @ManyToMany means many rows in a table map to many rows from others.
    eg. one courseId can map to many studentId, vice versa

## 7. What is the  cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true? and what are the other CascadeType and their features? In which situation we choose which one?
- The cascade attribute is set to CascadeType.ALL, meaning that all the JPA and Hibernate entity state transitions (e.g., persist, merge, remove) are passed from the parent Post entity to the PostComment child entities.

- The orphanRemoval attribute is going to instruct the JPA provider to trigger a remove entity state transition when a PostComment entity is no longer referenced by its parent Post entity.


## 8.  What is the  fetch = FetchType.LAZY, fetch = FetchType.EAGER? what is the difference? In which situation you choose which one?
- Lazy Loading is a design pattern that we use to defer initialization of an object as long as it's possible.

- Eager Loading is a design pattern in which data initialization occurs on the spot.


## 9.  What is the rule of JPA naming convention? Shall we implement the method by ourselves? Could you list some examples?


## 10. Try to use JPA advanced methods in your class project. In the repository layer, you need to use the naming convention to use the method provided by JPA.


## 11. (Optional) Check out a new branch(https://github.com/TAIsRich/springboot-redbook/tree/hw02_01_jdbcTemplate) from branch 02_post_RUD, replace the dao layer using JdbcTemplate.


## 12. (Optional) use JDBC to read the data from database.

## 3. What is JPQL?
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. But it wonâ€™t affect the database directly.

## 4. What is @NameQuery and @NamedQueries?
- @NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.
- @NamedQueries Specifies multiple named Java Persistence query language queries. Query names are scoped to the persistence unit. The NamedQueries annotation can be applied to an entity or mapped superclass.

## 5.  What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
- The @Query annotation declares finder queries directly on repository methods.

## 6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?

## 7. What is EntityManager?
- The EntityManager API is used to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key, and to query over entities. 

## 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
- SessionFactory is an Interface which is present in org. hibernate package and it is used to create Session Object. It is immutable and thread-safe in nature.

- Session is short-lived while SessionFactory objects are long-lived.
