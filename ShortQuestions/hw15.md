# HW 15
### 1. Can you tell something about docker container?
```
Docker containers are self-contained packages that include applications and their dependencies. They run as isolated systems within the host operating system and share resources with other containers. The goal of Docker containers is to eliminate the need for infrastructure dependencies when deploying and running applications. This allows containerized applications to run on any platform, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Essentially, Docker containers are runtime instances of Docker images.
```

### 2. What are docker images?
```
Docker images are self-contained packages that bundle application code, dependencies, and software packages. They are used to create containers, which can be spun up in any Docker environment to run the application.
```

### 3. What is a DockerFile?
```
DockerFile is a text file that has all commands which need to be run for building a given image.
```

### 4. Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?
```
A hypervisor is a software that enables virtualization and is also known as the Virtual Machine Monitor. It partitions the resources of the host system and assigns them to each guest environment that is installed.
```

### 5. What can you tell about Docker Compose?
```
A docker-compose file is a YAML file that contains information about the services, networks, and volumes needed to set up a Docker-based application. Docker-compose is used to create and host multiple containers and establish communication between them. Ports are exposed by each container to enable communication between the containers.
```

### 6. Can you tell something about docker namespace?
```
Docker namespaces in Linux provide resource partitioning in a mutually exclusive manner, which is a key concept in containerization. Namespaces create a layer of isolation between containers, which ensures that they are portable and do not impact the underlying host. Docker uses namespaces to achieve container isolation, and currently supports multiple namespace types, including PID, Mount, User, Network, and IPC.
```

### 7. What is the docker command that lists the status of all docker containers?
```
docker ps -a
```

### 8. On what circumstances will you lose data stored in a container?
```
The data of a container remains in it until and unless you delete the container.
```

### 9. What is docker image registry?
```
A Docker image registry is a storage area where Docker images are stored. Instead of converting applications to containers each time, developers can use images stored in the registry. Image registries can be public or private, with Docker Hub being the most well-known public registry.
```

### 10. How many Docker components are there?
```
The three components of Docker are Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry.

The Docker Client performs "build" and "run" operations and communicates with the Docker Host.

The Docker Host runs the main Docker daemon, which hosts containers and their associated images. The daemon communicates with the Docker Registry.

The Docker Registry stores Docker images and can be public or private. Popular public registries include Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.
```

### 11. What is a Docker Hub?
```
Docker Hub is a cloud-based public registry provided by Docker for storing and sharing public container images. It allows users to find, store, and share container images with others.

Users can push images to Docker Hub using the "docker push" command. Once an image is pushed to Docker Hub, it can be easily accessed and downloaded by others who have access to Docker Hub. This makes it easy for developers to share and collaborate on containerized applications.
```

### 12. What command can you run to export a docker image as an archive?
```
docker save -o <exported_name>.tar <container-name>
```

### 13. What command can be run to import a pre-exported Docker image into another Docker host?
```
docker load -i <export_image_name>.tar
```

### 14. Can a paused container be removed from Docker?
```
A container must be in the stopped state before we can remove it.
```

### 15. What command is used to check for the version of docker client and server?
```
docker version.
docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
```

### 16. Differentiate between virtualization and containerization.
```
Virtualization involves running multiple operating systems on the same physical server using a hypervisor. Each virtual machine runs a complete operating system and has its own set of resources, including CPU, memory, and storage. Virtualization provides complete isolation between the virtual machines, but it can be resource-intensive and less efficient than containerization.

Containerization, on the other hand, involves running multiple applications on the same operating system using containers. Containers provide an isolated environment for running applications, with each container sharing the same operating system kernel. This makes them lightweight, portable, and efficient, as they don't require the overhead of running multiple virtual machines. Containers can be easily moved between different hosts and can be scaled up or down quickly to meet changing demand.
```

### 17. Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile?
```
COPY and ADD are commands used for copying files into a container, but COPY is generally preferred because of its greater transparency. COPY provides basic support for copying local files into the container, while ADD includes additional features like support for remote URLs and automatic extraction of compressed files.
```

### 18. Can a container restart by itself?
```
Docker provides policies for automatically restarting containers when using the docker run command. These policies include:

Off: The container will not be automatically restarted if it is stopped or fails.

On-failure: The container will only restart automatically if it experiences a failure not associated with the user.

Unless-stopped: The container can only be restarted when the user manually executes the command to stop it.

Always: The container will always be automatically restarted, regardless of the reason for stopping or failure.
```

### 19. Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer?
```
A Docker image is built up from a series of read-only layers of instructions, with each layer corresponding to an instruction in the image's Dockerfile. Each layer is also an image that represents the instructions that were run and is used for speedy operation due to Docker's caching mechanism.
```

### 20. What is the purpose of the volume parameter in a docker run command?
```
To use volumes in Docker, the syntax of the docker run command is docker run -v host_path:docker_path <container_name>.

The volume parameter allows you to sync a directory in the container with a directory on the host. For example, docker run -v /data/app:usr/src/app myapp mounts the directory /data/app on the host to the /usr/src/app directory in the container.

This enables you to sync data files between the host and the container without needing to restart the container. It also ensures data security, as even if the container is deleted, the data of the container will still exist in the volume mapped host location, making it easy to store the container data.
```

### 21. Where are docker volumes stored in docker?
```
Docker volumes are managed and created by Docker, and can only be accessed by Docker entities. They are stored in the Docker host filesystem at the path /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
```

### 22. What does the docker info command do?
```
The command gets detailed information about Docker installed on the host system. The information can be like what is the number of containers or images and in what state they are running and hardware specifications like total memory allocated, speed of the processor, kernel version, etc.
```

### 23. Can you tell the what are the purposes of up, run, and start commands of docker compose?
```
The docker-compose up command starts or restarts all networks, services, and drivers associated with the app specified in the docker-compose.yml file. If run in "attached" mode, all container logs are accessible; if run in "detached" mode, logs are not shown.

The docker-compose run command is used to run one-off or ad-hoc tasks on a specific service and its dependent services, if any. This is useful for testing containers or adding/removing data from container volumes.

The docker-compose start command only restarts previously stopped containers and cannot create new containers.
```

### 24. What are the basic requirements for the docker to run on any system?
```
windows, macos, linux
```

### 25. Can you tell the approach to login to the docker registry?
```
docker login
```

### 26. List the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfile?
```
The FROM instruction in a Dockerfile sets the base image for subsequent instructions, and the file is considered valid only if it starts with this instruction.

The LABEL instruction is used to organize images by projects, modules, or licensing, and can be used for automation by defining key-value pairs that can be accessed programmatically.

The RUN instruction executes instructions on top of the current image in a new layer. Each execution adds a new layer that can be used in subsequent steps.

The CMD instruction provides default values for a running container. If multiple CMD commands are used, the last instruction will be considered.
```

### 27. Can you differentiate between Daemon Logging and Container Logging?
```
Docker supports logging at two levels: Daemon level and Container level.

At the Daemon level, there are four levels of logging: Debug, Info, Error, and Fatal. Debug contains all data from the daemon process, Info contains information and error details, Errors contains only error information, and Fatal contains fatal errors.

Container level logging can be accessed by running the command sudo docker logs <container_id>. Container level logging can also be accessed interactively by running sudo docker run -it <container_name> /bin/bash.
```

### 28. What is the way to establish communication between docker host and Linux host?
```
using ipconfig
```

### 29. What is the best way of deleting a container?
```
docker stop <container_id> or docker rm <container_id>
```

### 30. Can you tell the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
```
The CMD command in Docker provides default executable values for a container. To omit the executable, you can use the ENTRYPOINT instruction with the JSON array format. This command always runs when the container starts and allows you to configure parameters and executables. If the Dockerfile doesn't have this command, it inherits it from the base image specified in the FROM instruction.

The most commonly used ENTRYPOINT values are /bin/sh or /bin/bash for most base images. It is considered a good practice for every Dockerfile to have at least one of these two commands.
```

### 31. Can we use JSON instead of YAML while developing docker-compose file in Docker?
```
using docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up
```

### 32. How many containers you can run in docker and what are the factors influencing this limit?
```
depending on the hardware limitations, such as memory size, cpu.
```

### 33. Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container?
```
Created: This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
Running: In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
Paused: This state happens when the running container has been paused.
Stopped: This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
Deleted: In this, the container is in a dead state.
