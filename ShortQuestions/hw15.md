###  1.Can you tell something about docker container?
docker containers consist of applications and all their dependencies. Dockers are lighter than VMs.

### 2.What are docker images?
They are executable packages(bundled with application code & dependencies, software packages, etc.) for the purpose of creating containers

### 3. What is a DockerFile?
It is a text file that has all commands which need to be run for building a given image.
### 4. Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?
A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual Machine Monitor
### 5. What can you tell about Docker Compose?
It is a YAML file consisting of all the details needed for setting up Docker-based application
### 6. Can you tell something about docker namespace?
Namespaces in docker ensure that the containers are portable and they don't affect the underlying host
### 7. What is the docker command that lists the status of all docker containers?
docker ps -a

### 8.  On what circumstances will you lose data stored in a container?
When you delete the container
### 9. What is docker image registry?
A Docker image registry is an area where the docker images are stored
### 10. How many Docker components are there?
Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry.

+ Docker Client: This component performs “build” and “run” operations for the purpose of opening communication with the docker host.
+ Docker Host: This component has the main docker daemon and hosts containers and their associated images. The daemon establishes a connection with the docker registry.
+ Docker Registry: This component stores the docker images. There can be a public registry or a private one.

### 11. What is a Docker Hub?
It is a public cloud-based registry provided by Docker for storing public images of the containers 
### 12. What command can you run to export a docker image as an archive?
docker save -o <exported_name>.tar <container-name>
### 13. What command can be run to import a pre-exported Docker image into another Docker host
docker load -i <export_image_name>.tar
### 14. Can a paused container be removed from Docker?
No. container can only be removed if it is paused
### 15. What command is used to check for the version of docker client and server?
docker version
### 16. Differentiate between virtualization and containerization.
+ Visualization: This helps developers to run and host multiple OS on the hardware of a single physical server.
+ Containerization: This helps developers to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
### 17. Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile?
COPY provides just the basic support of copying local files into the container whereas ADD provides additional features like remote URL and tar extraction support.

### 18. Can a container restart by itself
Yes.
docker run -dit — restart [restart-policy-value] [container_name]
restart-policy-value: Off,  On-failure, Unless-stopped, Always
### 19. Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer
+ Image: This is built up from a series of read-only layers of instructions. An image corresponds to the docker container and is used for speedy operation due to the caching mechanism of each step.
+ Layer: Each layer corresponds to an instruction of the image’s Dockerfile. In simple words, the layer is also an image but it is the image of the instructions run

### 20. What is the purpose of the volume parameter in a docker run command?
The volume parameter is used for syncing a directory of a container with any of the host directories. This also ensures data security in cases of container deletion. This ensures that even if the container is deleted, the data of the container exists in the volume mapped host location making it the easiest way to store the container data.

### 21. Where are docker volumes stored in docker
They are stored in Docker host filesystem at /var/lib/docker/volumes/


### 22. What does the docker info command do?
The command gets detailed information about Docker installed on the host system. 
### 23. Can you tell  what are the purposes of up, run, and start commands of docker compose?
+ up: Using the up command for keeping a docker-compose up 
+ run: Using the run command, the docker-compose can run one-off or ad-hoc tasks based on the business requirements
+ start: only those containers can For Linux platforms, Docker can run on various Linux flavors such as Ubuntu >=12.04, Fedora >=19, RHEL >=6.5, CentOS >=6 etc.
  be restarted which were already created and then stopped

### 24. What are the basic requirements for the docker to run on any system
+ For the Windows platform, docker atleast needs Windows 10 64bit with 2GB RAM space. 
+ For Linux platforms, Docker can run on various Linux flavors such as Ubuntu >=12.04, Fedora >=19, RHEL >=6.5, CentOS >=6 etc.

### 25. Can you tell the approach to login to the docker registry?
Using the docker login command credentials to log in to their own cloud repositories can be entered and accessed.


### 26. List the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfile?
+ FROM: This is used to set the base image for upcoming instructions. A docker file is considered to be valid if it starts with the FROM instruction.
+ LABEL: This is used for the image organization based on projects, modules, or licensing. 
+ RUN: This command is used to execute instructions following it on the top of the current image in a new layer.
+ CMD: This command is used to provide default values of an executing container.

### 27. Can you differentiate between Daemon Logging and Container Logging?
+ Daemon Level: This kind of logging has four levels- Debug, Info, Error, and Fatal.
+ Container Level: Container level logging can be done using the command: sudo docker run –it <container_name> /bin/bash In order to check for the container level logs, we can run the command: sudo docker logs <container_id>
### 28. What is the way to establish communication between docker host and Linux host?
This can be done using networking by identifying the “ipconfig” on the docker host. This command ensures that an ethernet adapter is created as long as the docker is present in the host.
### 29. What is the best way of deleting a container?
- docker stop <container_id>
- docker rm <container_id>

### 30. Can you tell the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
+ CMD command provides executable defaults for an executing container
+ ENTRYPOINT specifies that the instruction within it will always be run when the container starts

### 31. Can we use JSON instead of YAML while developing docker-compose file in Docker?
Yes! It can be used. In order to run docker-compose with JSON, docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up can be used.


### 32. How many containers you can run in docker and what are the factors influencing this limit?
Depends on hardware restrictions.
### 33. Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container?
- Created: This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
- Running: In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
- Paused: This state happens when the running container has been paused.
- Stopped: This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
- Deleted: In this, the container is in a dead state.


### 34. How to use docker for multiple application environments?
+ Docker-compose feature of docker will come to help here. In the docker-compose file, we can define multiple services, networks, and containers along with the volume mapping in a clean manner, and then we can just call the command “docker-compose up”.
+ When there are multiple environments involved, we would want to define the server-specific dependencies and processes for running the application.  In this case, we can go ahead with creating environment-specific docker-compose files of the name “docker-compose.{environment}.yml” and then based on the environment, we can set up and run the application

### 35. How will you ensure that a container 1 runs before container 2 while using docker compose
The “depends_on” which got added in version 2 of docker-compose can be used as shown in a sample docker-compose.yml file below:
```agsl
version: "2.4"
services:
 backend:
   build: .
   depends_on:
     - db
 db:
   image: postgres
```
