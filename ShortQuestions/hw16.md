### 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
See annotations.md

### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
### 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?

- advantages:
    - It is non-invasive – not touching our code or business logic
    - It uses Spring’s IOC for dependency injection
    - Provision to create aspects using schema based (XML configuration) or @AspectJ annotation based style.
    - Easy to configure
  
- disadvantage:
    - Only methods with public visibility will be advised
    - Aspects cannot advise other Aspects - Not possible to have aspects to be the target of advice from other aspects.
    - A little difficult to debug the AOP based application code, Since the business classes are advised behind the scene with aspects
  
### 5.What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
An aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes

### 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
A Pointcut is a predicate that helps match an Advice to be applied by an Aspect at a particular JoinPoint.

### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
A Joinpoint is a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception.
### 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
An Advice is an action taken by an aspect at a particular Joinpoint. Different types of advice include “around,” “before,” and “after.”

### 10. When to use Spring Batch
You can use Spring Batch in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) and complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on)
### 11. How Spring Batch works?
Spring Batch follows the traditional batch architecture where a job repository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job.
### 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
- 1. Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
- 2. Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method.
### 13. What is the cron expression?
A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule.


### 14. What is the spring task?
Spring task scheduling for a task/job is a time based scheduled process which runs automatically as per the configuration supplied
### 15. When to use Spring task?
 data backup, regularly generate report, regularly crawl data
### 16. What is Filter and any filter example?

A filter is an object used to intercept the HTTP requests and responses of your application.
Ex.
- Before sending the request to the controller
- Before sending a response to the client.

### 17.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
A Spring interceptor is a class that either extends the HandlerInterceptorAdapter class or implements the HandlerInterceptor interface. Spring Interceptor are used to intercept client requests and process them
### 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
- prehandle() – called before the execution of the actual handler
- postHandle() – called after the handler is executed

### 19. What is Swagger

Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation
