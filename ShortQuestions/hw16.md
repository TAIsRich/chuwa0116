### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
```
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program. AOP is typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which implies that it defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut across multiple types and objects (often termed crosscutting concerns).
```

### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
```
Advantages:
1. Centralizes or modularizes the cross-cutting concerns: easy to maintain and make changes to the aspects and changes only need to be made in one place.
2. Easy to configure
3. It uses Spring’s IOC container for dependency injection: aspects can be configured as normal spring beans.
4. AOP is non-invasive: allows the developers to concentrate on the business logic, instead of the cross-cutting concerns
5. AOP is implemented in pure Java: there is no need for a special compilation unit or special class loader

Disadvantages:
1. Since the business classes are advised behind the scene with aspects, it's a little difficult to debug the AOP based application code.
2. Only methods with public visibility will be advised
3. Aspects cannot advise other Aspects - Not possible to have aspects to be the target of advice from other aspects.
```

### 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
```
An aspect is a cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts. A standard class tagged with the @Aspect annotation can be used to implement an aspect.
```

### 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
```
Pointcut is expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not. Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points and Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language.
```

### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
```
A Joinpoint is a point in Spring AOP during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception, etc. This symbolizes a point in your web application where you can easily plug in the AOP aspect of your software. In Spring AOP, a JoinPoint always represents a method execution.
```

### 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
```
Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. Advices are taken at a specific join point.

### 10. When to use Spring Batch?
```
You can use Spring Batch in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) and complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on). High-volume batch jobs can use the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.
```

### 11. How Spring Batch works?
```
A batch process is typically encapsulated by a Job consisting of multiple Steps. Each Step typically has a single ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter. A Job is executed by a JobLauncher, and metadata about configured and executed jobs is stored in a JobRepository.

Each Job may be associated with multiple JobInstances, each of which is defined uniquely by its particular JobParameters that are used to start a batch job. Each run of a JobInstance is referred to as a JobExecution. Each JobExecution typically tracks what happened during a run, such as current and exit statuses, start and end times, etc.

A Step is an independent, specific phase of a batch Job, such that every Job is composed of one or more Steps. Similar to a Job, a Step has an individual StepExecution that represents a single attempt to execute a Step. StepExecution stores the information about current and exit statuses, start and end times, and so on, as well as references to its corresponding Step and JobExecution instances.

An ExecutionContext is a set of key-value pairs containing information that is scoped to either StepExecution or JobExecution. Spring Batch persists the ExecutionContext, which helps in cases where you want to restart a batch run (e.g., when a fatal error has occurred, etc.). All that is needed is to put any object to be shared between steps into the context and the framework will take care of the rest. After restart, the values from the prior ExecutionContext are restored from the database and applied.

JobRepository is the mechanism in Spring Batch that makes all this persistence possible. It provides CRUD operations for JobLauncher, Job, and Step instantiations. Once a Job is launched, a JobExecution is obtained from the repository and, during the course of execution, StepExecution and JobExecution instances are persisted to the repository.
```

### 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
```
Using Spring's built-in scheduling features: Spring provides built-in scheduling features through the Task Scheduler and the Cron Expression language. Developers can use these features to schedule batch jobs to run at specific times or intervals. 
To use Spring's built-in scheduling features, developers can add the @Scheduled annotation to their batch job method and specify the schedule using either a fixed rate, a fixed delay, or a cron expression.
```

### 13. What is the cron expression?
```
A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field.
```

### 14. What is the spring task?
```
Spring Task is a feature of the Spring Framework that allows you to schedule tasks or jobs to run at a specific time or at regular intervals. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for scheduling tasks within a Spring application context.

Spring Task is built on top of the Java Executor framework and provides a way to execute tasks in a separate thread pool. This ensures that the main thread of the application is not blocked while the task is being executed. The task can be a simple method call or a complex job that requires more processing.
```

### 15. When to use Spring task?
```
We can use Spring Task when you need to schedule tasks or jobs to run at a specific time or at regular intervals within a Spring application context. Some scenarios are fit for using Spring task:
1. Sending emails: If your application needs to send out emails at specific times or intervals, Spring Task can be used to schedule the sending of these emails.
2. Running batch jobs: Spring Task is ideal for running batch jobs that need to be executed at a specific time or at regular intervals, such as generating reports or processing data.
```

### 16. What is Filter and any filter example?
```
In web development, a filter is a component that intercepts and processes HTTP requests and responses in a web application. Filters are used to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and data compression, and they can be applied to any servlet or JSP in a web application.

Filters are implemented as Java classes that implement the javax.servlet.Filter interface, and they can be configured in the web.xml deployment descriptor file of a web application.
```

### 17. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
```
An Interceptor is a function that is invoked by the framework BEFORE or AFTER an action invocation. It allows a form of Aspect Oriented Programming, which is useful for some common concerns such as: Request logging.

Interceptors are implemented as beans in the Spring Framework and can be used to modify the request or response before it is processed by the controller or view, or after it has been processed.
```

### 18. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
```
prehandle() – called before the execution of the actual handler.
postHandle() – called after the handler is executed.
```

### 19. What is Swagger?
```
Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.

With Swagger, developers can define APIs using a simple and intuitive YAML or JSON format, which can be easily read and understood by both humans and machines. The Swagger tools then use this definition to generate documentation, client libraries, and server stubs, which can significantly reduce development time and improve API quality.

Swagger also provides a user-friendly interface, known as Swagger UI, which allows developers to explore and test APIs directly from their web browsers. This interface displays the API documentation in a clear and organized way, making it easy for developers to understand the API's capabilities and parameters.
