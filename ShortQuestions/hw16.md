###  What is selenium? 
* Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.
### What is cumember?
* Cucumber was developed to make it easier for developers and testers to work together on behavior-driven development projects. It is based on the principle that tests should be written in a language everyone on the team can understand.
### What is JMeter
* The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance.
### What is unit-test?
* A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property.
### What is the life cycle of Junit?
* In JUnit 5, the test lifecycle is driven by four primary annotations i.e. @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach and @AfterAll.
### Should @BeforeAll method be class level?
* Yes, it's static method
### What is Mockito? and what is its limitation?
* Mockito is a framework of choice for most of the java based projects. It is easy to implement, read and understand. Some of the drawbacks or limitations in terms of functionality are: Its inability to mock static methods.
### What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
* @mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished for its interactions with the class under test
* @InjectMocks is the Mockito Annotation. It allows you to mark a field on which an injection is to be performed.
### What is stubbing?
* Stubbing, like mocking, means creating a stand-in, but a stub only mocks the behavior, but not the entire object. This is used when your implementation only interacts with a certain behavior of the object.
### What is Hamcrest Matchers?
* Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used
### Do you know @spy? What is difference between @spy and @Mock?
* Mocks are used to create fully mock or dummy objects. It is mainly used in large test suites. Spies are used for creating partial or half mock objects.
