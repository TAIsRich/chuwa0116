In general, checked exceptions represent errors outside the control of the program. For example, the constructor of FileInputStream throws FileNotFoundException if the input file does not exist.

If a program throws an unchecked exception, it reflects some error inside the program logic.For example, if we divide a number by 0, Java will throw ArithmeticException

the receiving method will get the returned value from the finally block.

###5
A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time, these are also called as compile time exceptions. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation, the programmer should take care of (handle) these exceptions.
An unchecked exception is an exception that occurs at the time of execution. These are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API. Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.

###6
The throws keyword is used to declare which exceptions can be thrown from a method, while the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code

###7
Because we want to catch exceptions in the order from specific to general so when we catch the exception, it delivers more information about the cause of error.

###7
Optional is a new type introduced in Java 8. It is used to represent a value that may or may not be present. In other words, an Optional object can either contain a non-null value (in which case it is considered present) or it can contain no value at all (in which case it is considered empty).

To finish and task and clean up normally involves close connection to file or dagtabases.

###9 Java8 new feature

Lamda Expression, Stream, default function

###10 Design Pattern

Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories - creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

Creational design pattern includes: 1. Singleton Pattern 2. Factory Pattern 3. Abstract Factory Pattern 4. Builder Pattern 5. Prototype Pattern

Structural design pattern includes : 1. Adapter Pattern 2. Composite Pattern 3. Proxy Pattern. 4. Flyweight Pattern 5. Facade Pattern 6. Bridge Pattern 7. Decorator Pattern

Behavioral Design Patterns includes 1. Template Method Pattern 2. Mediator Pattern 3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern 4. Observer Pattern5. Strategy Pattern 6. Command Pattern 7. State Pattern 8. Visitor Pattern 9. Interpreter Pattern 10. Iterator Pattern 11. Memento Pattern

###11
SOLID stands for:

S - Single-responsiblity Principle
O - Open-closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.


###12 How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?
Using static instance variable
using block to maintain syncronize system 
syncronize getinstance() method

###13 OCP
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In practice, this means creating software entities whose behavior can be changed without the need to edit and recompile the code itself.
