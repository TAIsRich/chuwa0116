1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
   * Spring: Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for robust programming and configuration model for Java-based applications.
   * Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone, Spring-based applications in a short period.
     * Spring Boot doesn't require XML configuration.
     * Embeds Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow directly.
     * There is no need to deploy WAR files while using SpringBoot.
     * Easier customization and management.
3. What is IOC and What is DI?
    * IOC(Inversion of control): Instead of managing objects by ourselves, transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework.
    * DI(Dependency Injection): Dependency injection is a way to implemented ioc, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies.
4. What is @ComponentScan?
    * It tells Spring in which packages you have annotated classes that should be managed by Spring.
5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?
    * annotation: @ComponentScan
    * xml: <context:component-scan base-package="org.example"/>
6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
    * @SpringBootApplication: is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.
7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
    * class level: @component, @service, @controller, @repository
    * method level: @bean inside class with @configuration
    * xml: <bean id="bean1" class="com.org.example.bean"></bean>
8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
    * @Component: Spring will register beans under the name of the class name.
    * @Bean: Spring will register beans using the class name of the bean class.
9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
   * @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
   * @Service annotates classes at service layer
   * @Repository annotates class at the persistence layer.
10. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?
    * @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, @Resource
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    * constructor injection
    * setter injection
    * interface injection:
    * constructor injection is better. A class needs something and thus asks for it before it can even be constructed.
12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring pick one bean to inject if no primary.
    * Use @Primary to annotate which bean to give  precedence to if there are two or more possible candidates.
    * Use @Qualifier together with the name of the specific implementation we want to use, we can avoid ambiguity when Spring finds multiple beans of the same type.
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
    * While the BeanFactory provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating beans.
    * ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory, and provides extra functionality like MessageSource, Access to resources, Event propagation to beans, Loading of multiple (hierarchical) contexts.
14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
    * The scope of a bean is the lifecycle of the bean.
    * Examples: singleton, prototype, request, session, global-session.
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
    ```
    <bean id="indexService" class="com.example.IndexService" />
    <bean id="..." class="...">
        <property name="service" ref="indexService" /></property>
    </bean>
    ```
