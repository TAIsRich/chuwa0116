**What is MVC pattern?**

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software design pattern commonly used in developing user interfaces. The pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.

**What is Front-Controller?**

A Front-Controller is a software design pattern that centralizes the processing of requests and coordinates the handling of these requests by delegating them to other components in a web application. It is a common architectural pattern used in web development to implement the centralized control of requests, and it provides a number of benefits, such as increased modularity, flexibility, and reusability.

**What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.**

DispatcherServlet is a central component of the Spring Framework's web MVC framework. It is a Front-Controller that receives incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate Controller for further processing.

**What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)**

JSP stands for JavaServer Pages, which is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java. JSP allows developers to embed Java code in HTML pages, which can be compiled and executed on the server side to generate dynamic content.

ModelAndView is a class in the Spring Framework that is used to represent the model and view components of a web application. It encapsulates the data returned by a controller method and the view that should be used to render the data to the user.
