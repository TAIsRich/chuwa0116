### Can you tell something about docker container?

Docker containers are executable packages that include everything needed to run an application. They offer consistency, isolation, and portability, making them a popular choice in DevOps and cloud computing environments for software development, testing, and deployment.

### What are docker images?

Docker images are snapshots of an application and its dependencies at a specific point in time. They are templates used to create Docker containers, which are lightweight, executable packages that contain everything needed to run an application. Images are created using a Dockerfile, which specifies the application and its dependencies, and can be shared and reused across different environments.

### What is a DockerFile?

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. The instructions specify the base image to use, how to configure the environment, which files to include, and what commands to run when building the image. Dockerfiles are used to automate the image-building process, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments. They can be version-controlled, shared, and reused across projects, making them a powerful tool in DevOps and cloud computing environments.

### Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a piece of software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. It creates and manages virtual machines (VMs), which are isolated and independent environments that run their own operating system and applications.

The hypervisor controls the allocation of physical resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth, to the virtual machines, ensuring that they operate efficiently and without interfering with each other. It also provides security and isolation between the VMs, preventing one VM from accessing or affecting another VM or the host system.

Hypervisors are commonly used in virtualization and cloud computing environments, where they enable efficient utilization of hardware resources, simplify management and deployment, and enhance security and isolation.

### What can you tell about Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes that make up an application, and then starts and stops the containers based on those definitions.

With Docker Compose, developers can define complex multi-container applications with a single command, making it easy to manage dependencies, scale applications, and ensure consistency across different environments. It also supports advanced features such as rolling updates, health checks, and environment variable management.

Docker Compose is commonly used in development and testing environments, as well as in production environments where multiple services need to be deployed and managed together.

### Can you tell something about docker namespace?

Docker namespace is a feature that provides process isolation and resource management for Docker containers. Each container runs in its own namespace, which is a separate instance of a global resource. The namespaces include:

1. PID namespace: isolates the process IDs, so that each container has its own PID namespace and sees only its own processes.
2. Network namespace: isolates the network interfaces, so that each container has its own network namespace and sees only its own network interfaces and routing tables.
3. Mount namespace: isolates the file system, so that each container has its own mount namespace and sees only its own file system and mounts.
4. IPC namespace: isolates the inter-process communication resources, so that each container has its own IPC namespace and sees only its own message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.

Docker namespaces enhance security, isolation, and resource management, making Docker containers lightweight, portable, and flexible.

### What is the docker command that lists the status of all docker containers?

`docker ps -a`

### On what circumstances will you lose data stored in a container?

When you delete the container.

### What is docker image registry?

It's a place to store docker images. An image registry can either be public or private and Docker Hub is the most popular and famous public image registry.

### How many Docker components are there?

There are three docker components: Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry.

- **Docker Client:** This component performs “build” and “run” operations for the purpose of opening communication with the docker host.
- **Docker Host:** This component has the main docker daemon and hosts containers and their associated images. The daemon establishes a connection with the docker registry.
- **Docker Registry:** This component stores the docker images. There can be a public registry or a private one. The most famous public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.

### What is a Docker Hub?

It is a public cloud-based place provided by Docker for storing images. You can push and pull public images from Docker Hub.

### What command can you run to export a docker image as an archive?

Use the docker save command: `docker save -o <exported_name>.tar <container-name>`.

### What command can be run to import a pre-exported Docker image into another Docker host?

Use the docker load command: `docker load -i <export_image_name>.tar`.

### Can a paused container be removed from Docker?

No it cannot. You must stop the container before you remove it.

### What command is used to check for the version of docker client and server?

`docker version`

### Differentiate between virtualization and containerization.

Virtualization abstracts the underlying hardware resources and enables multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, each with its own operating system and applications. Containerization, on the other hand, isolates the application and its dependencies in a lightweight, portable, and executable package, without requiring a separate operating system for each container. Virtualization provides strong isolation and security, but can be resource-intensive, while containerization is lightweight and scalable, but may have weaker isolation between containers.

### Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile?

Both the commands have similar functionality, but `COPY` is more preferred because of its higher transparency level than that of `ADD`.
`COPY` provides just the basic support of copying local files into the container whereas `ADD` provides additional features like remote URL and tar extraction support.

### Can a container restart by itself?

Yes, it is possible only while using certain docker-defined policies while using the docker run command. Following are the available policies:

- **Off:** In this, the container won’t be restarted in case it's stopped or it fails.
- **On-failure**: Here, the container restarts by itself only when it experiences failures not associated with the user.
- **Unless-stopped:** Using this policy, ensures that a container can restart only when the command is executed to stop it by the user.
- **Always:** Irrespective of the failure or stopping, the container always gets restarted in this type of policy.

To apply these policies: `docker run -dit — restart [restart-policy-value] [container_name]`

### Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer?

**Image:** This is built up from a series of read-only layers of instructions. An image corresponds to the docker container and is used for speedy operation due to the caching mechanism of each step.

**Layer:** Each layer corresponds to an instruction of the image’s Dockerfile. In simple words, the layer is also an image but it is the image of the instructions run.

Consider the example Dockerfile below.
`FROM ubuntu:18.04 COPY . /myapp RUN make /myapp CMD python /myapp/app.py Importantly, each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. `

The result of building this docker file is an image. Whereas the instructions present in this file add the layers to the image. The layers can be thought of as intermediate images. In the example above, there are 4 instructions, hence 4 layers are added to the resultant image.

### What is the purpose of the volume parameter in a docker run command?

The volume parameter is used for syncing a directory of a container with any of the host directories. This also ensures data security in cases of container deletion. This ensures that even if the container is deleted, the data of the container exists in the volume mapped host location making it the easiest way to store the container data.

### Where are docker volumes stored in docker?

Volumes are created and managed by Docker and cannot be accessed by non-docker entities. They are stored in Docker host filesystem at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

### What does the docker info command do?

The command gets detailed information about Docker installed on the host system. The information can be like what is the number of containers or images and in what state they are running and hardware specifications like total memory allocated, speed of the processor, kernel version, etc.

### Can you tell the what are the purposes of up, run, and start commands of docker compose?

- `docker-compose up` command is used to start and initialize the Docker Compose-defined containers. It creates the necessary network and volume resources, starts the containers in the right order, and streams the logs to the console.
- `docker-compose run` command is used to run a one-time command in a Docker Compose-defined service container. It starts the container, runs the command, and then stops the container.
- `docker-compose start` command is used to start existing Docker Compose-defined containers that have already been created but stopped. It starts the containers in the right order and runs them in the background.

These commands are part of the Docker Compose CLI and are used to manage multi-container Docker applications defined in a Docker Compose YAML file.

### What are the basic requirements for the docker to run on any system?

Docker has the following basic requirements to run on any system:

1. Operating System: Docker can run on most modern operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The specific requirements depend on the version of Docker being used.
2. Hardware: Docker requires a 64-bit CPU with hardware virtualization support, at least 2GB of RAM, and sufficient disk space to store images and containers.
3. Docker Engine: Docker requires the Docker Engine software to be installed and running on the host system. The Docker Engine manages the containers and images, and interacts with the Docker CLI and API.
4. Network Connectivity: Docker requires network connectivity to download images and access external services, such as registries and container orchestrators.

Meeting these requirements ensures that Docker can run smoothly on any system and provides the benefits of containerization, such as portability, scalability, and efficiency.

### Can you tell the approach to login to the docker registry?

Here's a high-level approach to login to a Docker registry:

1. Identify the Docker registry URL and the credentials to use to authenticate.
2. Open a terminal and run the `docker login` command followed by the registry URL.
3. Enter the username and password for the registry when prompted.
4. If the credentials are correct, Docker will log you into the registry and store a token that allows you to pull and push images to the registry.
5. After you have logged in, you can use the `docker pull` and `docker push` commands to interact with the images in the registry.

Note that some Docker registries, such as Docker Hub, may require additional steps to authenticate, such as using an access token or two-factor authentication. The specific steps may vary depending on the registry being used.

### List the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfile?

- **FROM:** This is used to set the base image for upcoming instructions. A docker file is considered to be valid if it starts with the FROM instruction.
- **LABEL:** This is used for the image organization based on projects, modules, or licensing. It also helps in automation as we specify a key-value pair while defining a label that can be later accessed and handled programmatically.
- **RUN:** This command is used to execute instructions following it on the top of the current image in a new layer. Note that with each RUN command execution, we add layers on top of the image and then use that in subsequent steps.
- **CMD:** This command is used to provide default values of an executing container. In cases of multiple CMD commands the last instruction would be considered.

### Can you differentiate between Daemon Logging and Container Logging?

- In docker, logging is supported at 2 levels and they are logging at the Daemon level or logging at the Container level.
- **Daemon Level:** This kind of logging has four levels- Debug, Info, Error, and Fatal.
  \- Debug has all the data that happened during the execution of the daemon process.
  \- Info carries all the information along with the error information during the execution of the daemon process.
  \- Errors have those errors that occurred during the execution of the daemon process.
  \- Fatal has the fatal errors that occurred during the execution.
- **Container Level:**
  \- Container level logging can be done using the command: `sudo docker run –it <container_name> /bin/bash`
  \- In order to check for the container level logs, we can run the command: `sudo docker logs <container_id>`

### What is the way to establish communication between docker host and Linux host?

This can be done using networking by identifying the “ipconfig” on the docker host. This command ensures that an ethernet adapter is created as long as the docker is present in the host.

### What is the best way of deleting a container?

We need to follow the following two steps for deleting a container:

- `docker stop <container_id>`
- `docker rm <container_id>`

### Can you tell the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

- `CMD` specifies the default command to run when a container starts, and it can be overridden by the `docker run` command or by specifying a `CMD` in a child image.
- `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the command that will always be executed when the container starts, and it cannot be overridden by the `docker run` command or child images.

In other words, `CMD` is used to specify the arguments that will be passed to the command that is executed when the container starts, while `ENTRYPOINT` is used to specify the actual command that will be executed.

To summarize, `CMD` is used to define a default command with optional arguments, while `ENTRYPOINT` is used to define the main command that should be run when the container starts, and it is typically used for executable scripts or application binaries.

### Can we use JSON instead of YAML while developing docker-compose file in Docker?

Yes, it can be used. In order to run docker-compose with JSON, `docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up` can be used.

### How many containers you can run in docker and what are the factors influencing this limit?

There is no clearly defined limit to the number of containers that can be run within docker. But it all depends on the limitations - more specifically hardware restrictions. The size of the app and the CPU resources available are 2 important factors influencing this limit. In case your application is not very big and you have abundant CPU resources, then we can run a huge number of containers.

### Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container?

The different stages of the docker container from the start of creating it to its end are called the docker container life cycle. 
The most important stages are:

- **Created:** This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
- **Running:** In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
- **Paused:** This state happens when the running container has been paused.
- **Stopped:** This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
- **Deleted:** In this, the container is in a dead state.

### How to use docker for multiple application environments?

- Docker-compose feature of docker will come to help here. In the docker-compose file, we can define multiple services, networks, and containers along with the volume mapping in a clean manner, and then we can just call the command “docker-compose up”.
- When there are multiple environments involved - it can be either dev, staging, uat, or production servers, we would want to define the server-specific dependencies and processes for running the application. In this case, we can go ahead with creating environment-specific docker-compose files of the name “docker-compose.{environment}.yml” and then based on the environment, we can set up and run the application.

### How will you ensure that a container 1 runs before container 2 while using docker compose?

Docker-compose does not wait for any container to be “ready” before going ahead with the next containers. In order to achieve the order of execution, we can use:

- The “depends_on” which got added in version 2 of docker-compose can be used as shown in a sample docker-compose.yml file below:

```plaintext
version: "2.4"
services:
 backend:
   build: .
   depends_on:
     - db
 db:
   image: postgres
```

The introduction of service dependencies has various causes and effects:

- The `docker-compose up` command starts and runs the services in the dependency order specified. For the above example, the DB container is started before the backend.
- `docker-compose up SERVICE_NAME` by default includes the dependencies associated with the service. In the given example, running `docker-compose up backend` creates and starts DB (dependency of backend).
- Finally, the command `docker-compose stop` also stops the services in the order of the dependency specified. For the given example, the backend service is stopped before the DB service.
