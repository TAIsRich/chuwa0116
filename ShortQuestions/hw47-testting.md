# HW47-testing

## 1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
see annotation.md

## 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?
Selenium provides a variety of tools and libraries for testing web applications, including a browser automation API that allows developers to control web browsers programmatically. With this API, developers can simulate user actions on web pages, interact with elements on a page, and perform automated tests to ensure that web applications are functioning as expected.

## 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
Cucumber is a testing framework used for behavior-driven development (BDD)

## 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
JMeter can be used to test the performance and scalability.
JMeter can simulate a large number of users accessing an application simultaneously and measure the response time and resource usage of the application under load.

## 5. what is unit-test?
Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they function works as intendeded.

## 6. What is the lifecycle of Junit?
@BoforeAll class level setup
@BoforeEach setup
@Test test execution
@AfterEach cleanup
@ AfterAll class level cleanup

## 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
yes

## 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
Mockito allows developers to create mock objects, specify their behavior, and verify that the behavior is as expected.

One limitation is that it only supports mocking and stubbing methods, and cannot create partial mocks or mocks of constructors. Additionally, Mockito cannot mock static methods or final classes/methods by default, although there are workarounds for these limitations.

## 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
@Mock is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. Mock objects are used in unit testing to isolate the code being tested from its dependencies.

@InjectMocks is used to inject mock objects created with @Mock into the object being tested.

## 10. What is the stubbing?
Stubbing is a software testing technique used to replace a real component with a simplified version of that component, known as a "stub". The purpose of stubbing is to isolate the component being tested from its dependencies, allowing for more focused testing and faster feedback cycles.

## 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a set of utility methods provided by Mockito to match arguments passed to mocked method calls. These methods allow you to specify the expected values for the arguments of the method calls that are being mocked.

## 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
It provides a set of reusable matchers that can be used to make assertions about the behavior of code under test. Matchers are essentially reusable test assertions that can be combined in different ways to form expressive and readable test cases.

## 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
@spy records information about the interactions between the test code and the object being spied on, while a @Mock is pre-programmed with expected behavior.
