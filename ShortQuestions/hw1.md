Validate: This step validates if the project structure is correct. For example â€“ It checks if all the dependencies have been downloaded and are available in the local repository.
Compile: It compiles the source code, converts the .java files to .class and stores the classes in target/classes folder.
Test: It runs unit tests for the project.
Package: This step packages the compiled code in distributable format like JAR or WAR.
Install: This step installs the packaged code to the local Maven repository.
Deploy: It copies the packaged code to the remote repository for sharing it with other developers.
