## 1.  List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
## 2.  what is selenium(YouTube)?
- Selenium is an open-source, portable software testing framework for web applications. It allows testers and developers to automate web browsers for testing web-based applications in different environments and operating systems. Selenium supports various programming languages, such as Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript, making it flexible and easy to integrate into existing development and testing workflows.
## 3.  what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
- Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It offers a way to write tests that anybody can understand, regardless of their technical knowledge. 

## 4.  what is JMeter(youtube)?
-  The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance.
## 5.  what is unit-test?
- A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property.
## 6.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
- the test lifecycle is driven by four primary annotations i.e. @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach and @AfterAll. Along with it, each test method must be marked with @Test annotation from package org.
## 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
- Yes, it should be class Level, because it must be run before all the test cases.
## 8.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
- When we need to test the units of our system, there are possibly some dependencis not yet implemented, so we could use mocking to replace that dependency. And Mockito is one of that framework that could be chosen for Java projects, and it's easy to read and understand. 
- The limitations: it could not mock static methods, and constructors, final and private methods could not be mocked.
## 9.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
- @mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished for its interactions with the class under test

- @InjectMocks is the Mockito Annotation. It allows you to mark a field on which an injection is to be performed.
## 10. What is the stubbing?
- A stub is a small piece of code that takes the place of another component during testing. The benefit of using a stub is that it returns consistent results, making the test easier to write. And you can run tests even if the other components are not working yet.
## 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
- Mockito provides the ArgumentMatchers class, which contains a set of methods that can be used to match arguments passed to a mocked method. These methods are typically used in conjunction with the when() method to stub a mocked method to return a specific value or perform a specific action based on the arguments passed to it.
## 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
- Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used.
## 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
- @Spy is another annotation provided by Mockito, which can be used to create a partial mock object. A partial mock object is a real object that is partially mocked, meaning that some of its methods are mocked while others are not.

- The @Mock annotation, on the other hand, is used to create a fully mocked object, where all of its methods are mocked.

- The key difference between @Spy and @Mock is that with @Spy, the real methods of the object are executed by default, whereas with @Mock, all methods are replaced by default with mock implementations.
