## 1.  List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
## 2.  what is selenium(YouTube)?
## 3.  what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
## 4.  what is JMeter(youtube)?
-  The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance.
## 5.  what is unit-test?
- A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property.
## 6.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
## 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
- Yes, it should be class Level, because it must be run before all the test cases.
## 8.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
- When we need to test the units of our system, there are possibly some dependencis not yet implemented, so we could use mocking to replace that dependency. And Mockito is one of that framework that could be chosen for Java projects, and it's easy to read and understand. 
- The limitations: it could not mock static methods, and constructors, final and private methods could not be mocked.
## 9.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
- @mock is a fake class that can be examined after the test is finished for its interactions with the class under test

- @InjectMocks is the Mockito Annotation. It allows you to mark a field on which an injection is to be performed.
## 10. What is the stubbing?
- A stub is a small piece of code that takes the place of another component during testing. The benefit of using a stub is that it returns consistent results, making the test easier to write. And you can run tests even if the other components are not working yet.
## 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
## 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
- Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used.
