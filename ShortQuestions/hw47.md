### What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source automation testing tool that is widely used to automate web browsers. It allows users to write test scripts in various programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and Ruby. Selenium provides a suite of tools for testing web applications, including Selenium IDE, Selenium WebDriver, and Selenium Grid.

Selenium IDE is a browser extension that allows users to record and playback interactions with a web application. Selenium WebDriver is a programming interface that provides a way to control web browsers through code. Selenium Grid is a tool that allows users to run tests in parallel on multiple machines and browsers.

Selenium can be used for a variety of tasks, including functional testing, regression testing, and load testing. It supports a wide range of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. Selenium is highly flexible and customizable, making it a popular choice among developers and testers.

### What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a popular open-source testing tool used for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) testing. It allows users to define test scenarios in a human-readable language and automatically execute them. Cucumber supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Ruby, and JavaScript.

Cucumber uses the Gherkin language, a syntax that defines test scenarios in a structured format that can be easily read and understood by stakeholders, developers, and testers. Gherkin is written in plain English and includes keywords such as "Given", "When", "Then", and "And" to define the steps of a scenario.

Cucumber can be integrated with other testing frameworks and tools, including Selenium and JUnit, to create a comprehensive testing suite. It allows testers to easily manage and organize their test scenarios, and provides detailed reports on test results.

Cucumber is especially useful for agile development teams that require close collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. It promotes a shared understanding of requirements and encourages developers to write code that meets the specific needs of the business.

### What is JMeter?

JMeter is an open-source tool used for load testing, performance testing, and functional testing of web applications. It was originally developed by the Apache Software Foundation and is written in Java. JMeter is designed to simulate heavy loads on a server, application, or network to determine its performance under different conditions.

JMeter can be used to test various types of web applications, including static and dynamic resources, web services, and databases. It allows users to create test plans and scenarios that simulate real-world usage of an application. JMeter supports multiple protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOAP, and JDBC.

JMeter can also be used for functional testing, which involves testing the functionality of an application to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected. It supports multiple assertions and response validation techniques to verify that an application is behaving as intended.

JMeter provides a user-friendly interface for creating and running tests, and it generates detailed reports on test results. It is highly extensible and can be customized with plugins and scripts to meet specific testing needs. JMeter is widely used in the software development industry for testing web applications and ensuring their reliability and performance.

### What is unit-test?

Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit performs as expected and meets its requirements.

Unit testing is typically performed by developers as part of the software development process, before the code is integrated into the larger application. The testing process involves creating test cases that exercise the unit's inputs, outputs, and behavior, and comparing the actual results with the expected results.

Unit tests are typically automated using testing frameworks and tools, such as JUnit, NUnit, or PyUnit, which help automate the test creation and execution process. The test results are reported to the developer, who can use the information to identify and fix bugs or issues in the code.

Unit testing helps improve the quality of software applications by detecting defects early in the development process, reducing the cost and time required for bug fixing, and improving the maintainability and extensibility of the code. It is an essential practice for building robust and reliable software applications.

### What is the lifecircle of Junit?

The lifecycle of JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java, typically involves the following stages:

1. Test Setup: In this stage, the test environment is set up, which includes initializing objects and configuring the system for testing. This is typically done in a method annotated with the `@Before` annotation.
2. Test Execution: In this stage, the test cases are executed using methods annotated with the `@Test` annotation. These methods typically contain one or more assertions that test the behavior or output of the unit being tested.
3. Test Teardown: In this stage, the test environment is cleaned up and resources are released. This is typically done in a method annotated with the `@After` annotation.
4. Test Report: In this stage, the test results are reported, typically in an HTML or XML format. JUnit generates a report that shows which tests passed, failed, or were skipped, along with any error messages or stack traces.

JUnit also provides several other annotations that can be used to customize the test lifecycle, such as `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass`, which are used to set up and tear down the test environment for an entire test class, rather than individual test methods.

By following the JUnit lifecycle, developers can ensure that their unit tests are reliable and repeatable, and that they accurately reflect the behavior of the units being tested. This can help improve the quality of the code and reduce the likelihood of defects and bugs in the application.

### What is @BeforeAll?

`@BeforeAll` is a JUnit annotation used to indicate that a method should be executed once before any of the tests in a test class are run. It is typically used to set up the test environment, such as initializing objects, connecting to a database, or starting a server.

The `@BeforeAll` method must be declared as `static` and have a `public` or `default` access level. It must also be defined in the same class as the test methods and can be used in conjunction with the `@AfterAll` annotation, which indicates a method that should be executed once after all tests in the test class are run.

The `@BeforeAll` annotation is useful for performing expensive or time-consuming setup tasks that only need to be performed once, rather than before each individual test method. By using `@BeforeAll` to perform setup tasks, developers can improve the performance of their tests and reduce the amount of code duplication.

It is important to note that `@BeforeAll` is different from the `@Before` annotation, which is used to indicate that a method should be executed before each individual test method.

### What is Mockito? What is its limitation?

Mockito is an open-source Java mocking framework used for creating mock objects to test the behavior of code in isolation. It allows developers to create mock objects that mimic the behavior of real objects, without actually invoking their methods. Mockito uses dynamic proxy to generate mock objects and provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating and configuring mocks.

Mockito can be used to test complex dependencies or interactions between objects, which can be difficult to test in isolation. By creating mock objects, developers can simulate the behavior of external dependencies, such as databases or web services, and focus on testing the behavior of their own code.

However, Mockito has some limitations that developers should be aware of:

1. Mockito cannot mock static methods or final classes: Mockito uses dynamic proxy to create mock objects, which cannot be used to mock static methods or final classes. To work around this limitation, developers can use tools such as PowerMock, which extends Mockito to support mocking of static methods and final classes.
2. Mockito can only mock non-private methods: Mockito can only mock non-private methods, as it uses reflection to create mock objects. This means that private methods cannot be tested using Mockito.
3. Mockito can lead to over-reliance on mocks: While mock objects can be useful for testing complex dependencies, over-reliance on mocks can lead to tests that are not reflective of the behavior of the actual code. Developers should use mocks judiciously and ensure that their tests are still representative of the behavior of the code in the real world.

Despite these limitations, Mockito remains a popular and useful tool for unit testing in Java and is widely used in the software development industry.

### What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

`@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` are both annotations provided by the Mockito mocking framework in Java.

`@Mock` is used to create a mock object for a class or interface, which can be used in place of the real object in unit tests. The `@Mock` annotation is typically used in conjunction with the `Mockito.mock()` method to create a mock object instance. The mocked object can then be used to test the behavior of other objects or methods that depend on the mocked object.

Here's an example:

```java
public class MyTestClass {
  @Mock
  private MyDependency dependency;

  // other test code
}
```

In this example, `MyDependency` is a class or interface that is used by the class being tested. The `@Mock` annotation is used to create a mock object instance for `MyDependency`.

`@InjectMocks` is used to inject the mocked object created using `@Mock` into the class being tested. This is typically done using constructor or setter injection. The `@InjectMocks` annotation can be used to simplify the process of injecting the mocked object into the test class.

Here's an example:

```java
public class MyTestClass {
  @Mock
  private MyDependency dependency;

  @InjectMocks
  private MyClassToTest classToTest;

  // other test code
}
```

In this example, `MyClassToTest` is the class being tested, and `MyDependency` is a dependency of `MyClassToTest`. The `@InjectMocks` annotation is used to inject the mocked object for `MyDependency` into `MyClassToTest`.

Together, `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` provide a powerful tool for creating and injecting mock objects into test classes, which can simplify the process of testing complex dependencies and interactions between objects.

### What is stubbing?

Stubbing is a technique used in software testing to replace a real method or function with a controlled, predictable implementation, known as a "stub". A stub is a simplified implementation of a method or function that returns predetermined results for specific input values.

In testing, stubbing can be used to isolate the code being tested from its dependencies, such as databases or external services, and to control the behavior of those dependencies during testing. By using stubs to simulate the behavior of dependencies, developers can test their code in isolation and ensure that it behaves correctly under different conditions.

Stubbing can be done using various mocking frameworks, such as Mockito or EasyMock, which provide APIs for creating stubs and configuring their behavior. For example, a developer might create a stub for a database query method that always returns a predetermined set of results, or a stub for a network request that always returns a successful response.

Here's an example of stubbing using Mockito in Java:

```Java
public class MyTestClass {
  @Mock
  private MyDependency dependency;

  @InjectMocks
  private MyClassToTest classToTest;

  @Test
  public void testMethod() {
    // Stub the behavior of MyDependency's getResponse() method
    when(dependency.getResponse()).thenReturn("Hello World");

    // Call the method being tested
    String result = classToTest.methodToTest();

    // Verify that the expected result was returned
    assertEquals("Hello World", result);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `when()` method is used to stub the behavior of the `getResponse()` method in `MyDependency`, so that it always returns the string "Hello World". This ensures that the test is predictable and reproducible, regardless of the actual behavior of the `MyDependency` class.

### What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

Mockito provides a set of argument matchers as part of its API, known as Mockito ArgumentMatchers. ArgumentMatchers are used to specify argument matching criteria when stubbing or verifying method calls on mock objects.

Mockito ArgumentMatchers support a variety of matching criteria, such as matching any argument of a specific type, matching any value of a specific type, or matching a value that satisfies a specific condition. These criteria can be used to define the behavior of mocked methods or to verify that a method was called with specific arguments during testing.

Here are some examples of Mockito ArgumentMatchers:

- `any()`: Matches any value of the specified type. For example: `when(mock.method(any(String.class))).thenReturn("result");`.
- `eq()`: Matches a specific value of the specified type. For example: `when(mock.method(eq("input"))).thenReturn("result");`.
- `isNull()`/`notNull()`: Matches a null or non-null value, respectively. For example: `when(mock.method(isNull())).thenReturn("result");`.
- `anyInt()`, `anyLong()`, `anyBoolean()`, etc.: Matches any value of the specified primitive type. For example: `when(mock.method(anyInt())).thenReturn("result");`.
- `argThat()`: Matches a value that satisfies a specific condition, as defined by a custom `ArgumentMatcher` implementation.

By using Mockito ArgumentMatchers, developers can write more concise and readable test code, and make it easier to stub or verify method calls on mock objects with complex argument matching criteria.

### What is Hamcrest Matchers?

Hamcrest Matchers is a Java library that provides a set of matchers for writing more expressive and readable assertions in tests. Hamcrest Matchers can be used with various testing frameworks, including JUnit, TestNG, and Mockito.

Hamcrest Matchers work by providing a set of reusable matchers, each of which encapsulates a specific assertion or comparison operation. For example, the `equalTo()` matcher compares two values for equality, while the `containsString()` matcher checks if a string contains a specified substring.

Here are some examples of Hamcrest Matchers:

- `equalTo()`: Matches if the object being tested is equal to a specified value. For example: `assertThat(result, equalTo(expected));`
- `hasSize()`: Matches if the object being tested has a specific size or length. For example: `assertThat(list, hasSize(3));`
- `contains()`: Matches if the object being tested contains a specific element. For example: `assertThat(list, contains("one", "two", "three"));`
- `instanceOf()`: Matches if the object being tested is an instance of a specified class. For example: `assertThat(result, instanceOf(String.class));`
- `isNull()`, `notNull()`: Matches if the object being tested is null or not null, respectively. For example: `assertThat(result, notNullValue());`

Hamcrest Matchers can be used in combination with other testing frameworks, such as JUnit or Mockito, to write more expressive and readable tests. By using Hamcrest Matchers, developers can make it easier to understand the purpose of tests and the conditions being tested, and to diagnose issues when tests fail.

### What is @Spy? What is difference between @Spy and @Mock?

2 / 2

`@Spy` and `@Mock` are both annotations used in Mockito to create mock objects, but they have different purposes and behaviors.

`@Mock` is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. The mock object has no behavior by default, and its methods return null, 0, or false by default. The developer can specify the behavior of the mock object by stubbing its methods using `when()` and `thenReturn()`, for example.

`@Spy` is used to create a partial mock object of a class. The spy object has the same behavior as the real object, but its behavior can be customized by stubbing its methods. By default, when a method is called on a spy object, the real implementation of the method is called, unless the method has been explicitly stubbed.

Here are some differences between `@Mock` and `@Spy`:

- `@Mock` creates a completely new object, whereas `@Spy` creates a partially mock object that wraps an existing object.
- `@Mock` methods have no behavior by default and must be explicitly stubbed, whereas `@Spy` methods have the same behavior as the real object by default.
- `@Mock` is typically used when a class or interface needs to be mocked entirely, whereas `@Spy` is typically used when only some methods of a class need to be mocked.
- `@Mock` can be used to create a mock object of an abstract class or an interface, whereas `@Spy` can only be used with concrete classes.

In summary, `@Mock` is used to create a mock object with no behavior by default, while `@Spy` is used to create a partial mock object with the same behavior as the real object by default.
