### 1. what is selenium?     

Selenium is an open-source, cross-platform tool for automating web browsers. It allows users to automate web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge) to simulate user interactions with web applications. Selenium provides a programming interface to control the browser actions and automate tasks like clicking links, filling out forms, and scrolling through pages.       

Selenium is commonly used for web application testing, particularly for testing web applications across multiple browsers and platforms. It can also be used for web scraping, data extraction, and other automation tasks. Selenium supports a variety of programming languages such as Python, Java, C#, and Ruby, making it accessible to developers with different language preferences.      

### 2. what is cucumber?     

Cucumber is a testing tool that is used for behavior-driven development (BDD). It provides a way to write tests in a human-readable language that can be easily understood by developers, testers, and business stakeholders. Cucumber is built on top of the Gherkin language, which is a plain-text language that uses keywords to describe the behavior of an application in a structured way.     

Cucumber allows teams to write tests in a way that is easily understood by everyone involved in the development process. It provides a common language for developers, testers, and business stakeholders to communicate and collaborate on the requirements and behavior of the application. Tests written in Cucumber can be executed using automation frameworks such as Selenium or Appium.      

Cucumber is widely used in agile software development methodologies, where it is used to create automated acceptance tests that are used to validate the functionality of an application. Cucumber tests are written in a way that is independent of the implementation details of the application, which means that they can be used to test the application regardless of the technology stack used to build it.      

### 3. what is JMeter?     

JMeter is an open-source tool that is used for load testing, performance testing, and functional testing of web applications. It was originally designed for testing web applications but has since been extended to support other protocols such as FTP, JDBC, and LDAP. JMeter can simulate large numbers of users and their actions on a website or application, allowing developers to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.        

JMeter provides a user-friendly graphical interface for creating test plans and scenarios. Test plans can be created by defining test scripts that simulate user actions, such as clicking links, filling out forms, and submitting data. JMeter can also be used to measure server performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and response times.      

JMeter is commonly used in software development organizations to ensure that web applications can handle a large number of users and maintain performance under high loads. It can be integrated with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, making it a valuable tool for ensuring the quality and performance of web applications throughout the development lifecycle.        

### 4. what is unit-test?       

A unit test is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the system. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit or component of the application is working as intended and to identify and fix any defects early in the development process.       

Unit tests are typically automated tests that are written by developers as part of the software development process. A unit test typically focuses on a small piece of code, such as a function or method, and verifies that it behaves correctly under various conditions. Unit tests are usually run every time the code is changed to ensure that new changes do not introduce any regressions or new defects.       

Unit testing can help improve the quality of software by catching defects early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing defects, and making it easier to maintain and refactor code. Unit tests also provide documentation for how the code should behave, making it easier for other developers to understand and work with the code.        

### 5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?       

1. Writing test cases: In this stage, the developer writes the test cases using JUnit framework. The test cases are typically written as methods that test individual units or components of the application.      

2. Compiling and running the test cases: The next step is to compile the test cases and run them using JUnit. This can be done using an integrated development environment (IDE) or a build tool such as Apache Maven or Gradle.      

3. Test execution: When the test cases are executed, JUnit creates an instance of the test class and invokes each test method. JUnit provides a set of annotations such as @Test, @Before, and @After to control the execution order and setup and teardown methods.      

4. Reporting: After the tests have been executed, JUnit generates a report that summarizes the test results. The report typically includes information such as the number of tests that passed or failed, the execution time, and any error messages.      

5. Debugging and fixing failures: If any test cases fail, the developer can use the error messages and stack traces provided by JUnit to debug and fix the failures.     

6. Continuous integration: JUnit can be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests whenever code changes are made. This helps to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality and maintains the quality of the codebase over time.
      

### 6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?     

Yes, the @BeforeAll method in JUnit should be declared as a static method, because it is invoked before any instance of the test class is created. The @BeforeAll method is used to perform any setup tasks that need to be executed once before any test methods are run.     

Declaring the @BeforeAll method as static ensures that it can be invoked without an instance of the test class, which is necessary because the instance of the test class has not yet been created at the time the @BeforeAll method is executed.      

### 7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?      

Mockito is an open-source mocking framework for Java that is used to create mock objects for unit testing. Mockito allows developers to create mock objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled manner, making it easier to test code that depends on other objects.      

Mockito provides a simple and easy-to-use API for creating and configuring mock objects. It allows developers to set expectations on mock objects, verify the behavior of mock objects, and specify the return values of mock objects. Mockito can also be used in conjunction with other testing frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG.     

While Mockito is a powerful tool for unit testing, it has some limitations that developers should be aware of:      

1. Limitations of mocking final classes and methods: Mockito cannot mock final classes and methods, which can be a limitation when testing code that depends on final classes or methods.      

2. Limitations of mocking static methods: Mockito cannot mock static methods, which can be a limitation when testing code that depends on static methods.      

3. Limitations of mocking private methods: Mockito cannot mock private methods, which can be a limitation when testing code that depends on private methods.     

4. Limitations of mocking classes without default constructors: Mockito cannot mock classes that do not have a default constructor, which can be a limitation when testing code that depends on classes with complex constructors.      

5. Limitations of testing performance: Mockito is designed for unit testing and may not be suitable for testing performance or scalability of an application.      

Overall, while Mockito is a powerful and easy-to-use mocking framework, it has some limitations that developers should keep in mind when using it for testing.      

### 8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?      

@Mock and @InjectMocks are annotations in the Mockito mocking framework for Java that are used to create and inject mock objects into a class being tested.     

@Mock is used to create a mock object for a class or interface. When a test class is executed, Mockito will create a mock object for each field annotated with @Mock. The mock object can then be configured with behavior using Mockito's API, and used in the test methods to simulate the behavior of a real object.       

@InjectMocks is used to inject the mock objects created using @Mock into the class being tested. When a test class is executed, Mockito will automatically inject the mock objects created using @Mock into the fields annotated with @InjectMocks. This simplifies the process of setting up the mock objects for testing.       

### 9. What is the stubbing?      

Stubbing is a technique used in testing to simulate the behavior of a dependency or object being used in a unit test. It involves creating a mock object that can be configured to return specific values or behave in a specific way when called by the code being tested.     

When a test method calls a method on the mock object, the mock object will return the value that has been configured for that method, instead of executing the original implementation of the method. This allows developers to test their code in isolation, without having to rely on the behavior of the real object being used in production.     

Stubbing is typically used when a dependency or object being used in a unit test is complex or difficult to create, or when the behavior of the object needs to be controlled in a specific way for testing purposes. By using stubbing, developers can create a simplified version of the object or dependency that behaves predictably and can be used to test the code being developed.     

### 10. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?     

Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a utility class in the Mockito mocking framework for Java that is used to match arguments passed to mock object methods in unit tests. ArgumentMatchers provides a set of predefined methods that can be used to match arguments based on their type, value, or other characteristics.      

Mockito ArgumentMatchers are used to configure the behavior of a mock object when its method is called with specific arguments. By using ArgumentMatchers, developers can create more flexible and generic test cases, as the behavior of the mock object can be configured to handle a range of argument values and types.      

### 11. what is Hamcrest Matchers?    

Hamcrest Matchers is a Java library that provides a set of matchers for use with testing frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG. Hamcrest Matchers provides a fluent and expressive way of writing assertions in unit tests, allowing developers to write more readable and maintainable tests.     

Hamcrest Matchers provides a large number of matchers that can be used to check conditions such as equality, comparison, type, and content. The library also allows developers to create custom matchers to handle specific testing scenarios.     

### 12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?     

@Spy and @Mock are both annotations in the Mockito mocking framework for Java that are used to create mock objects for unit testing. However, there are some key differences between them.     

@Mock is used to create a mock object for a class or interface, and all of its methods are mocked by default. The behavior of the mock object can be controlled using Mockito's API, and it is typically used to simulate the behavior of a real object in a controlled way.      

@Spy, on the other hand, is used to create a partial mock object for a class or interface, where some of the methods are mocked and some are not. The behavior of the spy object can be controlled using Mockito's API, but the unmocked methods will call the original implementation of the class being spied on.
