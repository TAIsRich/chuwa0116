### 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?

```
Selenium is a widely used open-source automation testing tool that allows users to test web applications across different browsers and platforms.
```

### 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?

```
Cucumber is a tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD) to write acceptance tests for web applications. It uses the Gherkin language to describe the expected behavior of the application in plain English.
```

### 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?

```
JMeter is an open-source tool that is primarily used for performance testing of web applications. It can simulate a heavy load on a server, and provide information about the server's performance under different conditions.
```

### 5. what is unit-test?

```
Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application, to ensure that each unit performs as expected.
```

### 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

```
The JUnit lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occur when running a JUnit test case. The lifecycle includes initialization of objects, executing the test methods, and teardown or cleanup activities.
```

### 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?

```
Yes, the @BeforeAll method should be a static method because it is called before any instance of the test class is created.
```

### 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

```
Mockito is a popular open-source mocking framework used for unit testing in Java. Its main limitation is that it can only mock public and protected methods, and cannot mock final classes or methods.
```

### 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

```
@Mock is an annotation used in Mockito to create a mock object of a class or interface. It is used to replace real objects in a test scenario with a fake implementation, allowing developers to simulate specific behavior and test their code more effectively.
On the other hand, @InjectMocks is an annotation that is used to inject the mocked dependencies into the object that is being tested. In other words, @InjectMocks is used to inject the dependencies into the object being tested that has the @Mock objects created.
```

### 10. What is the stubbing?

```
Stubbing involves creating a small piece of code, known as a stub, that replaces a real component in the system. The stub mimics the behavior of the component it replaces, providing predetermined responses to calls made to it by other parts of the system.
```

### 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

```
Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a utility class provided by the Mockito framework that provides a set of helper methods to simplify the creation of argument matchers for mock object method invocations.
```

### 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers

```
Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a set of matchers that can be used with testing frameworks like JUnit or Mockito. Hamcrest Matchers provide a way to write more expressive and readable test assertions, making it easier to understand what is being tested and what the expected result should be.
```

### 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

```
@Spy is an annotation used in Mockito to create a spy object, which is a real object that has been wrapped with a Mockito spy. A spy object behaves like a real object but also allows for behavior verification and mocking. The main difference between @Spy and @Mock is that @Spy uses the real object behavior as a default, while @Mock creates a completely fake object.
```
