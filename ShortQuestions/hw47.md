## 2 .what is selenium(YouTube)?
- Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.
## 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
- Cucumber is an open-source software testing tool written in Ruby. Cucumber enables you to write test cases that anyone can easily understand regardless of their technical knowledge
## 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
- The Apache JMeter is an open-source, purely Java-based software. The software is used to perform performance testing, functional testing, and load testing of web applications. It is used to test load testing functional behavior and measuring performance.
## 5.  what is unit-test?
- A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property.
## 6.What is the life circle of Junit?
- A JUnit test case can contain many test methods. Each method identified as a test will be executed within the JUnit test lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of three pieces: setup, test and teardown, all executed in sequence.
## 7.Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
- Yes
## 8.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
- Mockito provides a framework that can mock objects with the help of Java's Reflection API, therefore we can separate the function we want to test in JUnit test from other functions that are invoked in JUnit and don't need testing.
## 9.What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
- The @Mock annotation is used to create mock objects that can be used to replace dependencies in a test class. The @InjectMocks annotation is used to create an instance of a class and inject the mock objects into it, allowing you to test the behavior of the class.
## 10.What is the stubbing?
- A method stub or simply stub in software development is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality. A stub may simulate the behavior of existing code (such as a procedure on a remote machine; such methods are often called mocks) or be a temporary substitute for yet-to-be-developed code.
## 11.what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
- Argument matchers are mainly used for performing flexible verification and stubbing in Mockito. It extends ArgumentMatchers class to access all the matcher functions. Mockito uses equal() as a legacy method for verification and matching of argument values.
## 12.what is Hamcrest Matchers
- Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used.
## 13.do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
- Both can be used to mock methods or fields. The difference is that in mock, you are creating a complete mock or fake object while in spy, there is the real object and you just spying or stubbing specific methods of it. When using mock objects, the default behavior of the method when not stub is do nothing.
