### 1.  List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
### 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?

Selenium is a widely used open-source automation testing tool that allows users to test web applications across different browsers and platforms.


### 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?

In the context of Java testing, cucumber is a testing framework that allows developers to write automated tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Cucumber enables developers, testers, and business stakeholders to collaborate and define the requirements and behavior of the software in a human-readable format using Gherkin language syntax.

### 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?

JMeter is an open-source software tool that is widely used for performance testing, load testing, and functional testing of web applications.

### 5. what is unit-test?


Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application, to ensure that each unit performs as expected.


### 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?


The JUnit lifecycle refers to the sequence of events that occur when running a JUnit test case. The lifecycle includes initialization of objects, executing the test methods, and teardown or cleanup activities.


### 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?


Yes. This annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed once before all test methods in a test class are run.

### 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?

Mockito is a popular open-source mocking framework used for unit testing in Java. Its main limitation is that it can only mock public and protected methods, and cannot mock final classes or methods.

### 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

@Mock is an annotation used in Mockito to create a mock object of a class or interface. It is used to replace real objects in a test scenario with a fake implementation, allowing developers to simulate specific behavior and test their code more effectively.
On the other hand, @InjectMocks is an annotation that is used to inject the mocked dependencies into the object that is being tested. In other words, @InjectMocks is used to inject the dependencies into the object being tested that has the @Mock objects created.

### 10. What is the stubbing?

Stubbing involves creating a small piece of code, known as a stub, that replaces a real component in the system. The stub mimics the behavior of the component it replaces, providing predetermined responses to calls made to it by other parts of the system.

### 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Mockito ArgumentMatchers is a utility class provided by the Mockito framework that provides a set of helper methods to simplify the creation of argument matchers for mock object method invocations.

### 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers

Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a set of matchers that can be used with testing frameworks like JUnit or Mockito. Hamcrest Matchers provide a way to write more expressive and readable test assertions, making it easier to understand what is being tested and what the expected result should be.

### 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?

@Spy is an annotation used in Mockito to create a spy object, which is a real object that has been wrapped with a Mockito spy. A spy object behaves like a real object but also allows for behavior verification and mocking. The main difference between @Spy and @Mock is that @Spy uses the real object behavior as a default, while @Mock creates a completely fake object.
