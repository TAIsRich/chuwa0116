### 1. What is MVC pattern?    
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.      

The Model is responsible for managing the data and business logic of the application. It represents the application's data and the rules for manipulating the data.      

The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It takes input from the user and sends it to the controller for processing.     

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the view, processes it by interacting with the model, and updates the view accordingly.      

The main advantage of using the MVC pattern is that it allows for a clear separation of concerns between the different components of the application. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application, as changes to one component do not affect the others. Additionally, it allows for more flexibility and modularity, as each component can be modified or replaced without affecting the others.     

### 2. What is Front-Controller?    
Front-Controller is a software design pattern used in web applications that provides a centralized point of control for handling requests. In this pattern, all incoming requests are intercepted by a single component, known as the front controller, which is responsible for routing the request to the appropriate handler.     

The front controller acts as a single entry point for all requests and is responsible for common tasks such as authentication, security, and routing. It receives the request from the client and then forwards it to the appropriate controller, which then processes the request and returns a response to the front controller. The front controller then sends the response back to the client.     

The main advantage of using a front controller is that it provides a centralized point of control for handling requests, which makes it easier to manage the application and maintain consistency across the application. It also enables the application to provide a uniform interface to clients, regardless of the underlying architecture of the application.      

Frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Zend Framework use the front-controller pattern to provide a structured approach to building web applications.     

### 3. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.      
DispatcherServlet is a key component of the Spring Framework's web architecture, used to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate controller in a web application.      

When a request is received by the web server, it is first intercepted by the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet is configured in the web.xml file and is responsible for delegating the request to the appropriate handler, based on the request URL.       

The DispatcherServlet uses a set of handler mappings to determine which controller should handle the request. These mappings are defined in the Spring configuration file and specify the mapping between the request URL and the controller that should handle the request.      

Once the appropriate controller has been identified, the DispatcherServlet passes the request to the controller. The controller processes the request and returns a ModelAndView object, which contains both the data to be displayed and the view to be rendered.     

The DispatcherServlet then uses a set of view resolvers to determine which view should be used to render the data. These view resolvers are also defined in the Spring configuration file and specify the mapping between the view name and the actual view file.       

Once the view has been determined, the DispatcherServlet renders the data and returns the resulting HTML to the client.    

Overall, the DispatcherServlet provides a central point of control for handling incoming requests and delegating them to the appropriate handler, making it easier to manage and maintain a web application. It also provides a flexible and configurable framework for mapping requests to controllers and views, making it easier to build complex web applications.    

### 4. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?     
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages and is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java web applications. JSP allows developers to embed Java code into HTML pages, which can be executed dynamically on the server before being sent to the client. JSP is part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform and is often used together with servlets to build web applications.     

A ModelAndView is a class in the Spring Framework that is used to pass both data and the name of the view to be rendered back to the client in a web application. A ModelAndView object contains two main parts:         
1. The data model - This is a Map object that contains the data that will be displayed in the view. The keys in the map represent the names of the data attributes, while the values represent the actual data.      
2. The view name - This is a String that represents the name of the view that will be used to render the data. The view name can be a JSP, a Thymeleaf template, a FreeMarker template, or any other type of view that can be rendered by the web application.    

### 5. Could you please google any other servlets?    
1. HttpServlet: This is the base class for all servlets that handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides methods for handling GET and POST requests, as well as for setting response headers and content.    
2. Filter: This is a servlet-like component that intercepts requests and responses before they are processed by the servlets. Filters can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and request processing.   
3. SessionServlet: This is a servlet that provides session management capabilities in a web application. It allows developers to create, access, and manipulate user sessions, which can be used to store user data across multiple requests.     
4. RequestDispatcher: This is a servlet that provides a way to forward or include a request to another resource, such as another servlet or a JSP. It allows developers to build modular and reusable web components by breaking down a large application into smaller, interconnected parts.    
5. AsyncContext: This is a servlet that provides asynchronous processing capabilities in a web application. It allows developers to handle long-running tasks without tying up server resources or blocking other requests.     

### 6. How many web server do you know?     
1. Apache HTTP Server: This is a widely used open-source web server that supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is known for its stability, performance, and extensive module ecosystem.    
2. Nginx: This is a lightweight, high-performance web server and reverse proxy that is designed to handle large amounts of traffic. It is often used to serve static content, as well as to load balance and proxy requests to backend servers.      
3. Microsoft IIS: This is a web server that is included with Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is known for its integration with other Microsoft technologies, such as ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL Server.       
4. Google Web Server (GWS): This is a proprietary web server used by Google to serve its web pages. It is optimized for high performance and scalability, and is designed to handle massive amounts of traffic.     
5. Lighttpd: This is a lightweight, open-source web server that is designed for high-performance and low resource consumption. It is often used to serve static content, as well as to proxy and load balance requests to backend servers.
