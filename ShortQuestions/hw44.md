### What is Spring MVC pattern?

The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.

- The **Model** encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO.
- The **View** is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.
- The **Controller** is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.

### What is Front-Controller?

A front controller is a design pattern commonly used in web applications to handle incoming requests from the client and to provide a centralized point of control for the application's flow. It is responsible for receiving all incoming requests, handling common tasks such as authentication and authorization, and then directing the request to the appropriate controller or action.

The front controller pattern is often used in conjunction with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where the front controller is the single point of entry for all requests and is responsible for invoking the appropriate controller to handle the request. This approach helps to ensure a consistent user experience and simplifies the development and maintenance of the application.

In the context of the Spring Framework, the DispatcherServlet is the front controller for Spring MVC. It receives all incoming requests and then delegates them to the appropriate controller or handler method based on the URL and other factors. The DispatcherServlet also provides a number of features that are common to many web applications, such as request mapping, view resolution, and exception handling.

Overall, the front controller pattern provides a powerful mechanism for managing the flow of requests in a web application and can help to simplify development and maintenance over the life of the application.

### What is DispatcherServlet? Please decribe how it works.

The DispatcherServlet is a key component of the Spring MVC framework that acts as a front controller and the central hub for handling all incoming requests in a Spring web application. It is essentially a servlet that receives incoming HTTP requests from the client, processes them, and then delegates them to the appropriate handler method or controller for further processing.

There are five main roles in the DispatcherServlet workflow, namely DispatcherServlet, HandlerMapping, Controller, ViewResolver, and View.

Here's how the DispatcherServlet works:

1. The client sends a request to the server for a specific resource such as a web page, an image or some other content. The request is received by the web container (e.g. Tomcat or Jetty) which passes it to the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet is configured as the front controller for the Spring MVC application, so it is the first point of contact for all incoming requests.
2. The DispatcherServlet consults the HandlerMapping with the request.
3. The HandlerMapping will find the appropriate Controller and method and return them to DispatcherServlet.
4. the DispatcherServlet delegates the request to the controller for further processing. The Controller takes the request and calls the appropriate service methods. This could include retrieving data from a database, performing business logic or invoking other services.
5. The controller then returns a ModelAndView object which contains the model data and the view name to be rendered.
6. The DispatcherServlet call the ViewResolver with the view name.
7. The ViewResolver will pickup the defined view template for the request.
8. The DispatcherServlet passes the model data to the View engine, which renders the view template and the model data into HTML.
9. The View engine returns the rendered HTML to the DispatcherServlet.
10. The DispatcherServlet returns the HTTP response to the front end.

### What is JSP? What is ModelAndView?

JSP stands for JavaServer Pages and is a technology for creating dynamic web pages that are platform-independent and can be rendered by web servers that support Java. JSP allows Java code to be embedded into HTML pages, enabling developers to create dynamic content and user interfaces for web applications.

JSP pages are compiled into Java servlets at runtime and are executed on the server side. The output of a JSP page is sent to the client as an HTML document, which can be displayed in a web browser.

ModelAndView, on the other hand, is a class in the Spring MVC framework that is used to encapsulate the model data and the view name that will be rendered by the DispatcherServlet. The model data can be any object, such as a collection of domain objects or a map of key-value pairs, that the view can use to render the content.

The ModelAndView class has two main properties: the model and the view. The model is a Map that contains the data to be displayed in the view, while the view is a string that represents the logical name of the view to be rendered. The view is typically resolved by a ViewResolver, which maps the logical view name to an actual view implementation.

When a controller method returns a ModelAndView object, the DispatcherServlet uses the model data and view name to render the final output that will be sent to the client. The view is responsible for rendering the model data into an HTML response that the client's browser can display.

Overall, ModelAndView is a useful class in the Spring MVC framework that provides a simple and flexible mechanism for passing model data to a view and rendering the final output for the client.

### Do you know any other servlets?

There are several other types of servlets besides the DispatcherServlet used in the Spring MVC framework. Here are a few examples:

1. HttpServlet - This is the base class for all HTTP servlets and provides methods for handling HTTP requests and responses. It is typically extended by developers to create custom servlets that handle specific types of requests.
2. Filter - A filter is a servlet that intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses to perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, or encryption. Filters are configured in the web.xml file and can be used to perform pre-processing or post-processing on requests and responses.
3. HttpSessionListener - This is a listener interface that is used to receive notifications when a new session is created or destroyed in a web application. It can be used to perform various tasks such as initializing user sessions or cleaning up resources when a session is destroyed.
4. ServletContextListener - This is a listener interface that is used to receive notifications when the servlet context is initialized or destroyed. It can be used to perform various tasks such as initializing database connections, caching resources or starting background tasks.
5. AsyncContext - This is an interface that is used to enable asynchronous processing of requests in a servlet. It provides methods for suspending and resuming the request processing, as well as for setting timeouts and error handling.

Overall, servlets are a powerful and flexible technology for developing web applications in Java, and there are many different types of servlets available for handling various aspects of the request/response cycle.

### What web server do you know?

There are many web servers available for hosting and serving web applications, both open-source and commercial. Here are a few examples:

1. Apache Tomcat - This is an open-source Java-based web server and servlet container that is widely used for hosting Java web applications. It supports the Servlet and JSP specifications and is often used in conjunction with the Spring framework.
2. Jetty - This is an open-source Java-based web server and servlet container that is known for its lightweight and fast performance. It is often used for hosting embedded applications or microservices and is commonly used in the development of web frameworks and libraries.
3. JBoss - This is an open-source Java-based application server that provides a platform for deploying and running Java-based web applications. It supports a wide range of Java technologies and frameworks, including Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, and JPA.
4. Nginx - This is a popular open-source web server that is often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer. It is known for its high performance and scalability and is commonly used for serving static content and handling large volumes of traffic.
5. Apache HTTP Server - This is an open-source web server that is widely used on the internet. It supports a wide range of platforms and is highly configurable, making it suitable for hosting a variety of web applications.
