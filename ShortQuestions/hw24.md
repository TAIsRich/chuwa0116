###1. Explain volatile variables in java? (we also use it in Singleton)
volatile helps gaurantee the visibility and order for thread, blocked thread will be notified

###2. how to create a new thread(Please also consider Thread Pool case)?
Extends the thread class Implements the runnable interface Implement the callable interface

###3. Difference between Runnable and Callable

Runnable no return values, Callable can return value

###4 . what is the diff between t.start() and t.run()?
t.start(0 is to create another thread then run t.run() is use the current thread to run

###5.Which way of creating threads is better: Thread class or Runnable interface?

Runnable interface is better, it will inherit all the thread methods if it extends the thread class, which we only need the run method.

###6.what is the thread status?
The cycle of a thread is New Runnable Blocked Waiting Timed Waiting Terminated

###7. difference between wait() and sleep() method
difference between wait() and sleep() method wait() is defined in the object class, it tells the calling thread to wait until another thread invokes notify() or notifyAll() to wake up. The thread waits until it reobtains the ownership of the monitor and Resume’s Execution. Sleep() is a method to pause the execution of current thread for a specific time in milliseconds. Here, Thread does not lose its ownership of the monitor and resumes it’s execution

###8. What is deadlock
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 

###9. how do threads communicate with each other?
wait() and notify or notifyAll() to communicate with each other.

###10. what is join() method?
Join() is a synchronization method, it will block the calling thread(the thread who call the method) until the thread whose join method is called has completed. This can ensure that a thread has terminated.

###11. what is yield() method
It can stop the currently executing thread and will give a chance for other waiting threads that have the same priority. If there is no waiting thread or other waiting thread has low priority, then the same thread will continue to execute.

###12. Explain thread pool
In multithreaded application, thread pool is a "pool of available threads" that can be used by your application.

###13. What is Executor Framework in Java, its different types and how to create these executors?
The Executor Framework contains a bunch of components that are used to efficiently manage multiple threads. It was released with the JDK 5 which is used to run the Runnable objects without creating new threads every time and also mostly re-using the already created threads.

###14. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor
The shutdown() method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating, while the shutdownNow() method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.

###15. What is Atomic classes? when do we use it?

use atomicInteger like classed to use addAndGet(int i) like mothod to maintain threadsafe

###16. What is the cocurrent collections?
java provided thread-safe data structure class 

###17. what kind of locks you know?
ReentrantLock; ReadWriteLock; StampedLock;

###18. What is the difference between class lock and object lock?
class lock can be used when we want to prevent multiple threads to enter the synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime.
object lock can be used when we want non-static method or non-static block of the code should be accessed by only one thread.

###19. What is future and completableFuture?
Future are basically the placeholders for a result of an operation that has not finished yet. Once the operation finished, the Future will contain that result.
CompletableFuture implements the Future interface, so we can use it as a Future implementation, but with additional completion logic.

###20. what is ThreadLocal?
ThreadLocal is used to create the thread local variables to avoid synchronization.

###21.Type the code by your self and try to understand it. (package com.chuwa.tutorial.t08_multithreading)

###22. Read those interview questions and pick some important questions to this home work.

 static class PrintRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            synchronized (monitor) {
                while (value <= 10) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + value++);
                    monitor.notify();
                    try {
                        if (value < 11) {
                            monitor.wait();
                        }
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

###24.
private static synchronized void printNumber() {
        int count = 10;
        while (count-- > 0) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + n++);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

        PrintNumber1.class.notifyAll();
    }
