1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md

2. what is selenium

Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP.

3. what is cucumber

Cucumber is an open-source software test automation framework for behavior-driven development. It uses a business-readable, domain-specific language called Gherkin for specifying feature behaviors that become tests.

4. what is JMeter

Apache JMeter is an open source Java application designed to load test functional behavior and gauge software performance.

5. what is unit-test

Unit testing refers to the testing of individual components in the source code, such as classes and their provided methods. The writing of tests reveals whether each class and method observes or deviates from the guideline of each method and class having a single, clear responsibility.

6. What is the lifecircle of Junit

A JUnit test case can contain many test methods. Each method identified as a test will be executed within the JUnit test lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of three pieces: setup, test and teardown, all executed in sequence.

7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)

No

8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations

To help understand Mockito's limitations, it's important to realize what Mockito is doing for you: Mockito creates a dynamic (proxy-based) subclass of the class you pass in. This means that, like a subclass you would write yourself, you won't have access or control over private fields and methods, static methods, and local variables. There is no workaround.

9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks

The @Mock annotation is used to create mock objects that can be used to replace dependencies in a test class. The @InjectMocks annotation is used to create an instance of a class and inject the mock objects into it, allowing you to test the behavior of the class.

10. What is the stubbing

A stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values. It's injected into the class under test to give you absolute control over what's being tested as input. A typical stub is a database connection that allows you to mimic any scenario without having a real database.

11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers

Argument matchers are mainly used for performing flexible verification and stubbing in Mockito. It extends ArgumentMatchers class to access all the matcher functions.

12. what is Hamcrest matchers

Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation or data filtering, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used.

13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mockito

Both can be used to mock methods or fields. The difference is that in mock, you are creating a complete mock or fake object while in spy, there is the real object and you just spying or stubbing specific methods of it.
