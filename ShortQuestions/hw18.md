# HW 18
### 1. list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. Document the microservice architecture and components/tools/dependencies
```
1. Spring Cloud
2. Zuul API Gateway (balancing loads of the micro-services)
3. Eureka (Service Registry Center)
4. Ribbon **Load Balancer** -> balancing loads of the providers
5. Hystrix **Circuit Breaker**
6. Config Server
7. Kafka (Event based asynchronous communication between two services)
8. Docker (Deployment of services)
```

### 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
```
Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure.

The circuit breaker pattern is an application resiliency pattern used to limit the amount of requests to a service based on configured thresholds — helping to prevent the service from being overloaded.

### 4. Read this article, then list the important questions, then write your answers
   a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices
```
Q1. What are the main components of Microservices.
1. Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration
2. IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception]
3. Cloud Infrastructure
4. API Gateway
5. Enterprise Service Bus
6. Service Delivery

Q2. What are the benefits of Microservices?
1. Self-contained, and independent deployment module.
2. Independently managed services.   
3. In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.   
4. It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.  
5. A greater degree of scalability and agility.   
6. Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.  
7. Better communication between developers and business users.   
8. Development teams of a smaller size.

Q3. What are the drawbacks of Microservices?
1. Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.  
2. Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.   
3. Pre-planning is essential.  
4. Complex development.  
5. Requires a cultural shift.  
6. Expensive compared to monoliths.   
7. Security implications.
8. Maintaining the network is more difficult.

### 5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
    a. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/
    b. https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions
```
The process of sharing the incoming traffic (in discrete time) between servers using a server pool is load balancing. This process of sharing can be evenly scaled or executed using specific rules such as Round Robin, Least Connections, etc.

Two types of load balancing microservices architecture are used: server side load balancing and client side load balancing.

Server side load balancing involves the classical load balancing approach wherein the traffic is distributed using a load distributor that is placed in front of the servers. This distributor routes the load equally or according to certain rules to the servers which then perform the work.

In client side load balancing, the client handles the entire load balancing and the client API is expected to know all the instances of server API addresses that are available hard-coded within a service registry. Using this method, it is possible to escape bottlenecks and single points of failure that may occur. When using service discovery, you don’t have to know any information about the server API except the registered name of the API. The server registry mechanism provides all the information about the server API.
