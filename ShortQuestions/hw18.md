## 3 What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

Resiliency patterns are a type of service architecture that help to prevent cascading failures and to preserve functionality in the event of service failure. Common resiliency patterns used in application development include the bulkhead pattern and circuit breaker pattern. These patterns often incorporate other resiliency techniques like fallback, retry, and timeout.

The circuit breaker pattern is an application resiliency pattern used to limit the amount of requests to a service based on configured thresholds — helping to prevent the service from being overloaded.

Explain the working of Microservice Architecture.

Clients: Different users send requests from various devices. 
Identity Provider: Validate a user's or client's identity and issue security tokens. 
API Gateway: Handles the requests from clients. 
Static Content: Contains all of the system's content. 
Management: Services are balanced on nodes and failures are identified. 
Service Discovery: A guide to discovering the routes of communication between microservices. 
Content Delivery Network: Includes distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. 
Remote Service: Provides remote access to data or information that resides on networked computers and devices. 


Write difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture.

Monolithic Architecture: It is "like a big container" where all the software components of an application are bundled together tightly.  It is usually built as one large system and is one code-base. 
SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture): It is a group of services interacting or communicating with each other. Depending on the nature of the communication, it can be simple data exchange or it could involve several services coordinating some activity.   
Microservice Architecture: It involves structuring an application in the form of a cluster of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. The functional modules can be deployed independently, are scalable, are aimed at achieving specific business goals, and communicate with each other over standard protocols. 


What issues are generally solved by spring clouds?

The following problems can be solved with spring cloud:   

Complicated issues caused by distributed systems: This includes network issues, latency problems, bandwidth problems, and security issues. 
Service Discovery issues: Service discovery allows processes and services to communicate and locate each other within a cluster. 
Redundancy issues: Distributed systems can often have redundancy issues. 
Load balancing issues: Optimize the distribution of workloads among multiple computing resources, including computer clusters, central processing units, and network links. 
Reduces performance issues: Reduces performance issues caused by various operational overheads. 


## 5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.

Server Side Load Balancing

Server side load balancing is a classical load balancing. The traffic is distributed by a load distributor placed in front of the servers and distributed to the servers that will perform the main work equally or according to certain rules. As examples most common used server side load balancers nginx, netscaler etc.

Client Side Load Balancing

In client side load balancing, client handles the load balancing. In this case client api should know all instance of server api addresses via hard coded or with a service registry.
With this method you can escape bottlenecks and single point of failures. If you use service discovery you don’t have to know any information about server api except api registered name, server registry mechanism will give all information about server api.
