1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.

2. What is MVC pattern?

it is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. Here's a brief overview of each of the components in the MVC pattern.

- Model: This component represents the data and business logic of the application. It typically includes classes that define the data structure, as well as methods for manipulating that data.
- View: This component represents the user interface of the application. It typically includes classes that define the layout and appearance of the user interface, as well as any user interaction elements such as buttons, menus, or forms.
- Controller: This component acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives input from the user, updates the Model accordingly, and then updates the View to reflect the changes in the Model. It typically includes classes that handle user input and communicate with the Model and View components.

4. What is Front-Controller?

The Front-Controller pattern is a software design pattern that provides a centralized entry point for handling requests in a web application. The main idea behind the pattern is to have a single component, called the Front Controller, responsible for receiving and handling all incoming requests.

5. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

The DispatcherServlet is a key component of the Spring MVC web framework. It acts as the Front Controller for Spring-based web applications, receiving incoming requests and dispatching them to the appropriate controllers or handlers for processing.

6. What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ(please google to have a basic knowlege)

JSP is a view technology used to generate dynamic web pages by embedding Java code directly into HTML pages. It allows developers to write Java code that is executed on the server-side and generates HTML pages dynamically based on data received from the Model component. JSP pages can be compiled into Java servlets at runtime, making them efficient and fast.
ModelAndView is a class used in Spring MVC to combine both the Model and View components into a single object. It allows developers to pass data from the Model component to the View component for rendering. The Model component contains the application data, while the View component is responsible for rendering the data into an appropriate format (e.g. HTML). The ModelAndView object provides a simple and flexible way to pass data to the View component and specify which View should be used for rendering the response.

7. Could you please google any other servlets

- HttpServlet: A base class for servlets that handle HTTP requests and responses. It provides methods for handling various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and for sending HTTP responses.
- Filter: A component that intercepts incoming requests and outgoing responses and performs some processing on them before they are handled by the servlet. Filters are often used for tasks such as authentication, logging, and request/response modification.
- HttpSession: A class that represents a user session in a web application. It allows data to be stored and retrieved across multiple requests from the same user, and is often used for storing user-specific information such as login credentials and shopping cart contents.

8. How many web server do you know?

- Tomcat: An open-source web server and servlet container that is widely used for running Java web applications. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
- Jboss: A popular open-source application server platform that is widely used for running Java-based enterprise applications. It was originally developed by JBoss Inc., which was later acquired by Red Hat in 2006.
- Nginx: A lightweight, high-performance web server that is often used as a reverse proxy or load balancer. It is known for its scalability and ability to handle high traffic volumes.
- Lighttpd: A lightweight, high-performance web server that is often used for serving static content or as a reverse proxy. It is known for its speed and low resource usage.

9. clone this repo, and run it in you local. a. <https://github.com/TAIsRich/springmvc5-demo> b. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides. c. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API. d. remeber to create a database for this project e. all details in the slides.
