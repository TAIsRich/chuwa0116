# Homework 11

## Part1 exception-validation

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

### 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
Spring @Configuration annotation allows us to use annotations for dependency injection. 


### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
When something goes wrong with your application, the server displays an exception page defining the type of exception, the server-generated exception page is not user-friendly. Spring MVC provides exception handling for your web application to make sure you are sending your own exception page instead of the server-generated exception to the user. The @ExceptionHandler annotation is used to detect certain runtime exceptions and send responses according to the exception. In this article we’ll Spring Mvc project to show how to intercept and define exceptions, we’ll look at how to define method level as well as the class level exception.

### 4. How do you do the validations in Spring?
In Spring, you can perform input validations using the javax.validation API, which is a standard part of Java. Here are the basic steps to perform input validation in Spring:

1. Add the javax.validation and hibernate-validator dependencies to your project. You can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage your dependencies.
2. Annotate the fields in your model classes with validation annotations. 
3. In your controller method, add an @Valid annotation before the model object that you want to validate. This will trigger the validation process.
4. If the input is invalid, Spring will throw a MethodArgumentNotValidException. You can handle this exception in a number of ways, such as returning a custom error response.


### 5. What is the actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator is a feature of the Spring Boot framework that provides additional endpoints for your application, which can be used to monitor and manage your application at runtime. These endpoints expose information about your application, such as health status, performance metrics, and environment details. The Actuator endpoints are implemented using Spring MVC and can be accessed through HTTP requests or JMX (Java Management Extensions) clients.

Some examples of Actuator endpoints are:

/actuator/health: Returns the health status of the application.
/actuator/info: Returns general information about the application.
/actuator/metrics: Returns various metrics of the application, such as memory usage, request count, etc.
/actuator/env: Returns the environment details of the application, such as system properties and environment variables.
Actuator endpoints can also be customized or extended to provide additional information or functionality specific to your application.

Actuator is a very useful feature for monitoring and managing your application in production environments, as it provides valuable information about the application's health and performance, without the need for additional tools or libraries.

## Part2 spring

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
Spring is a lightweight open-source Java development framework. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for developing enterprise level Java applications. It aims to simplify enterprise Java development and helps developers build applications more effectively and efficiently. Spring focuses on several areas of application development and provides a wide range of features.

Spring Boot is an extension of Spring, which eliminates the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application. Featuring default codes and annotation based configuration, Spring Boot enables a faster and more efficient development ecosystem. Since Spring Boot is built on top of Spring, it offers all the features and benefits of Spring. Spring Boot aims to reduce code length and provides developers with the easiest way to build an application.

Spring vs. Spring Boot
Spring is the most popular application development framework in Java. However, over the past few years, Spring has become increasingly complex because of added functionalities. Starting a new project usually requires going through a lengthy process and takes a lot of time.

To avoid starting from scratch and to save time, Spring Boot was introduced. Spring Boot uses Spring as its foundation layer and allows developers to build a standalone application with none or minimal configuration. It is targeted specifically towards building web applications and microservices.

### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?

### 7. How many ways we can define a bean?
There are 3 ways to define a bean. 
1. Creating Bean Inside an XML Configuration File (beans.xml)
2. Using @Component Annotation
3. Using @Bean Annotation

### 8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
