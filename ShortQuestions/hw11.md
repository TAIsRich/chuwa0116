# Homework 11

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

### 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
Spring @Configuration annotation allows us to use annotations for dependency injection. 


### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
When something goes wrong with your application, the server displays an exception page defining the type of exception, the server-generated exception page is not user-friendly. Spring MVC provides exception handling for your web application to make sure you are sending your own exception page instead of the server-generated exception to the user. The @ExceptionHandler annotation is used to detect certain runtime exceptions and send responses according to the exception. In this article we’ll Spring Mvc project to show how to intercept and define exceptions, we’ll look at how to define method level as well as the class level exception.

### 4. How do you do the validations in Spring?
In Spring, you can perform input validations using the javax.validation API, which is a standard part of Java. Here are the basic steps to perform input validation in Spring:

1. Add the javax.validation and hibernate-validator dependencies to your project. You can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage your dependencies.
2. Annotate the fields in your model classes with validation annotations. 
3. In your controller method, add an @Valid annotation before the model object that you want to validate. This will trigger the validation process.
4. If the input is invalid, Spring will throw a MethodArgumentNotValidException. You can handle this exception in a number of ways, such as returning a custom error response.


### 5. What is the actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator is a feature of the Spring Boot framework that provides additional endpoints for your application, which can be used to monitor and manage your application at runtime. These endpoints expose information about your application, such as health status, performance metrics, and environment details. The Actuator endpoints are implemented using Spring MVC and can be accessed through HTTP requests or JMX (Java Management Extensions) clients.

Some examples of Actuator endpoints are:

/actuator/health: Returns the health status of the application.
/actuator/info: Returns general information about the application.
/actuator/metrics: Returns various metrics of the application, such as memory usage, request count, etc.
/actuator/env: Returns the environment details of the application, such as system properties and environment variables.
Actuator endpoints can also be customized or extended to provide additional information or functionality specific to your application.

Actuator is a very useful feature for monitoring and managing your application in production environments, as it provides valuable information about the application's health and performance, without the need for additional tools or libraries.
