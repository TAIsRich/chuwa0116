#### 1. what is the @configuration and @bean?    
In the context of Spring Framework, @Configuration and @Bean are annotations that are used to define and configure beans.     

@Configuration is an annotation that is used to declare a class as a configuration class. A configuration class defines the beans that will be managed by the Spring container. In other words, it tells Spring how to create and configure the objects that it needs to manage.     

@Bean is an annotation that is used to define a bean. A bean is simply an object that is managed by the Spring container. When a method is annotated with @Bean, it tells Spring that the method will return an object that should be managed as a bean. Spring will then call the method to create the object and add it to the container.     

Here is an example of how @Configuration and @Bean can be used together:     

```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

In this example, the @Configuration annotation tells Spring that AppConfig is a configuration class. The @Bean annotation on the myService method tells Spring that it should create a bean called myService by calling the MyServiceImpl constructor. Spring will then manage the MyService object and make it available for injection into other components.     

#### 2. How do you handle the exception in Spring?      
In Spring, there are several ways to handle exceptions:     

Using @ExceptionHandler - Spring provides an annotation called @ExceptionHandler that can be used to handle exceptions thrown by a specific controller or globally across the application. When an exception is thrown, Spring looks for an appropriate @ExceptionHandler method and invokes it to handle the exception. Here is an example:      
1. Using @ExceptionHandler - Spring provides an annotation called @ExceptionHandler that can be used to handle exceptions thrown by a specific controller or globally across the application. When an exception is thrown, Spring looks for an appropriate @ExceptionHandler method and invokes it to handle the exception. Here is an example:     
```
@ControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandlerAdvice {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex) {
        ErrorResponse error = new ErrorResponse("500", ex.getMessage());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```
In this example, @ControllerAdvice is used to define a global exception handler, and @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class) is used to specify that this handler should handle all exceptions. The handler method creates an ErrorResponse object and returns it with a 500 Internal Server Error status.   

2. Using @ControllerAdvice - @ControllerAdvice is also used to define a global exception handler that can be used to handle exceptions across the entire application. Here is an example:    
```
@ControllerAdvice
public class ExceptionHandlerAdvice {

    @ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public void handleNotFoundException() {
        // Handle the exception here
    }
}
```
In this example, @ControllerAdvice is used to define a global exception handler, and @ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class) is used to specify that this handler should handle NotFoundException exceptions. The handler method simply returns a 404 Not Found status.      

#### 3. How do you do the validations in Spring?    
In Spring, you can perform validations using the javax.validation API and the @Valid annotation.     
Here are the steps to validate a Spring bean:    
1. Add validation annotations to the bean properties - You can add validation annotations such as @NotNull, @Size, @Min, @Max, and @Pattern to the properties of the bean that need to be validated. Here is an example:    
```
public class User {

    @NotNull
    private String name;

    @Size(min = 8, max = 20)
    private String password;

    // Getters and setters
}
```
In this example, the name property is annotated with @NotNull to ensure that it is not null, and the password property is annotated with @Size to ensure that its length is between 8 and 20.     

2. Add the @Valid annotation to the controller method parameter - You can add the @Valid annotation to a controller method parameter to tell Spring to validate the object before binding it to the parameter. Here is an example:    
```
@PostMapping("/users")
public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
    // Create the user here
    return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
}
```
In this example, the createUser method is annotated with @PostMapping to handle a POST request, and the @RequestBody annotation is used to bind the request body to the user parameter. The @Valid annotation is added to the user parameter to tell Spring to validate the User object before binding it.      

3. Handle validation errors - If validation fails, Spring will throw a MethodArgumentNotValidException exception. You can handle this exception using an @ExceptionHandler method or by defining a global exception handler. Here is an example:     
```
@ControllerAdvice
public class ValidationExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleValidationException(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        BindingResult bindingResult = ex.getBindingResult();
        List<ObjectError> errors = bindingResult.getAllErrors();
        String message = errors.get(0).getDefaultMessage();
        ErrorResponse error = new ErrorResponse("400", message);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```
In this example, @ControllerAdvice is used to define a global exception handler, and @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class) is used to specify that this handler should handle validation exceptions. The handler method gets the validation errors from the exception and creates an ErrorResponse object to return with a 400 Bad Request status.    

By following these steps, you can perform validations in Spring using the javax.validation API and the @Valid annotation.     

#### 4. What is the actuator?     
Spring Boot Actuator is a feature of the Spring Boot framework that provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application. It exposes a set of RESTful endpoints or JMX beans that can be used to interact with the application at runtime.    

Actuator endpoints provide insight into the internals of your application, such as:    

Application health    
Metrics    
Configuration properties    
Logging    
Thread dump    
Environment details    
System information    
etc.    
The Actuator is designed to be used in production environments to provide a way to monitor and manage the application without the need for external tools or custom code.    

By default, Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are secured and require authentication to access. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.    

You can configure Actuator in your application by adding the spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency to your project's classpath. The Actuator will then be enabled by default and you can access its endpoints by sending HTTP requests to the endpoint URLs. The endpoints are typically exposed on the /actuator path, such as http://localhost:8080/actuator/health.    

Actuator is a powerful tool that provides you with the means to monitor and manage your Spring Boot application in a production environment.
