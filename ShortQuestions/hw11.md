## 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
- Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for robust programming and configuration model for Java-based applications.

- Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone, Spring-based applications in a short period.

- It reduces lots of development time and increases productivity. It avoids writing lots of boilerplate Code, Annotations and XML Configuration. It is very easy to integrate Spring Boot Application with its Spring Ecosystem like Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring Data, Spring Security etc.


## 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
- Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 

- The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.


## 4.  What is  @CompnonentScan?
- One of the most important annotations in spring is @ComponentScan which is used along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. @ComponentScan without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.



## 5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton? 
```java
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd">
               
     <context:component-scan base-package="org.example"/>
</beans>
@ComponentSacn

```



## 6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
- Spring Boot @SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning.
## 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
- There are three different ways in which you can define a Spring bean: 
    - annotating your class with the stereotype @Component annotation (or its derivatives) 
    - writing a bean factory method annotated with the @Bean annotation in a custom Java configuration class. 
    - declaring a bean definition in an XML configuration file.


## 8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
- The default bean name will be method name. It means first bean name is getBeanA and second bean name is getBeanB . A bean can be accessed by bean class or bean name or can be injected in component using @Autowired annotation.



## 9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
- @Component – Indicates a auto scan component. 
- @Service – Indicates a Service component in the business layer.
- @Repository – Indicates DAO component in the persistence layer. 

## 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
- The injection in Spring is either done via setter, field or constructor injection. Classes which are managed by Spring DI must conform to the Java bean standard. In the context of Spring classes are also referred to as beans or as spring beans.


## 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
There are three main styles of dependency injection, according to Fowler: 
- Constructor Injection (also known as Type 3)
- Setter Injection (also known as Type 2) 
- Interface Injection (also known as Type 1).

Constructor-based dependency injection is certainly considered a best practice.

## 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
- annotate the object generating method in the @Configuration class with @Primary
- If there is no primary, use @Qualifier

## 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
- BeanFactory is a fundamental container that provides the basic functionality for managing beans, while ApplicationContext is an advanced container that extends the BeanFactory that provides all basic functionality and adds some advanced features.

- BeanFactory is suitable to build standalone applications, while ApplicationContext is suitable to build Web applications, integration with AOP modules, ORM and distributed 
applications.
- BeanFactory supports only Singleton and Prototype bean scopes, while ApplicationContext supports all types of bean scopes such as Singleton, Prototype, Request, Session etc.


## 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
- singleton - only one instance of the spring bean will be created for the spring container. This is the default spring bean scope. While using this scope, make sure bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues.

- prototype – A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested from the spring container.
- request – This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.
- session – A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.
- global-session – This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.


## 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
```
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public TransferService transferService() {
        return new TransferServiceImpl();
    }
}
<beans>
    <bean name="transferService" class="com.company.TransferServiceImpl"/>
</beans>
<bean class="org.springframework.config.java.process.ConfigurationPostProcessor"/> 
```
