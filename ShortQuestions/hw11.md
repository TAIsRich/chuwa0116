### What is the @configuration and @bean?

- `@Configuration` is used to mark a Java class as a configuration class. A configuration class is responsible for defining the beans that will be managed by the Spring container. It is usually placed on top of a Java class that contains methods annotated with `@Bean`.
- `@Bean` is used to define a bean in Spring Framework. It is used on a method that returns an instance of a bean that will be managed by the Spring container. The method name is used as the bean name by default, but it can be specified using the `name` attribute of the `@Bean` annotation.

### How do you handle the exception in Spring?

- Use ExceptoionHandler
- Create ErrorDetails Class
- Create GlobalexceptionHandler Class
- Test using Postman Client

### How do you do the validations in Spring?

- Import dependency
- Add validation rule to payload
- Add @valid to controller to apply the rule here
- Check it in Postman

### What is the actuator?

- In the Spring Framework, Actuator is a set of tools and endpoints that provide insight into the application's internal state and performance. It is a feature that provides a set of production-ready features for monitoring and managing the Spring Boot application.

### What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Springboot?

- Spring is an open-source application framework for the Java platform. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring is widely used in enterprise software development for building web, desktop, and mobile applications.

  Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that provides a faster and easier way to create and deploy Spring-based applications. It is designed to simplify the configuration and deployment of Spring applications by providing a set of opinionated defaults and preconfigured settings.

- Faster development: Spring Boot simplifies the development process by providing preconfigured settings and defaults, reducing the time spent on configuration.

- Easy integration: Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate with other technologies such as databases, security, and messaging systems.

- Microservices support: Spring Boot is a popular choice for building microservices due to its lightweight architecture and fast development cycle.

### What is IOC and What is DI?

- Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

  In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.

- Dependency injection is a pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies.

  Connecting objects with other objects, or “injecting” objects into other objects, is done by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves.

### What is @ComponentScan?

- We use the `@ComponentScan` annotation along with the `@Configuration` annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. `@ComponentScan` without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.

### How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?

- In XML-based configuration, you can define the package to be scanned using the `context:component-scan` element with the `base-package` attribute
- In annotation-based configuration, you can use the `@ComponentScan` annotation on a configuration class to specify the base package to scan. For example:

### What is @SpringbootApplication?

- Spring Boot `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more `@Bean` methods and also triggers `auto-configuration` and component scanning. It’s same as declaring a class with `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@ComponentScan` annotations.

### How many ways we can define a bean?

- Class level
- Method level
- XML

### What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?

- Annotated method name

### What is the difference between @Component and @Service, @Repository?

- In Spring, `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository` are all specialized versions of the `@Component` annotation that provide additional semantic meaning to the class. Here's a brief overview of the differences between these annotations:
  1. `@Component`: This is a generic stereotype annotation that indicates a class is a Spring-managed component. It can be used to annotate any class in a Spring application context.
  2. `@Service`: This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a service component in the business layer of the application. It is typically used to annotate classes that encapsulate business logic and perform complex operations.
  3. `@Repository`: This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a repository component in the data access layer of the application. It is typically used to annotate classes that interact with a database or other data storage system.

### How many annotation we can use to inject the bean?

- `@Autowired`: This annotation can be used to inject a bean by type, and is the most commonly used annotation for dependency injection in Spring. If there are multiple beans of the same type, you can use the `@Qualifier` annotation to specify the bean name.
- `@Resource`: This annotation can be used to inject a bean by name, and can also be used to inject other resources such as a JNDI object or a JDBC `DataSource`.
- `@Inject`: This annotation is part of the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) specification, and is functionally equivalent to `@Autowired`. It can be used to inject a bean by type, and also supports the `@Qualifier` annotation.
- `@Value`: This annotation can be used to inject a value from a property file or other configuration source. It can be used to inject a string value, or to perform conversion to other types using Spring's `ConversionService`.
- `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`: These annotations can be used to specify initialization and destruction methods for a bean, respectively. Methods annotated with `@PostConstruct` will be called after the bean has been constructed and all dependencies have been injected, while methods annotated with `@PreDestroy` will be called before the bean is destroyed.

In general, `@Autowired` is the most commonly u

### Tell me three ways to do dependency injection

- Construct Injection
- Setter Injection
- Field Injection

### If we have multiple bean for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primary.

- Simply put, use @Primary to give higher preference to a bean when there are multiple beans of the same type.

### What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

#### BeanFactory

#### ApplicationContext

- Bean instantiation/wiring
- Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration
- Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration
- Convenient MessageSource access
- ApplicationEvent publication
