### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
```
`@Configuration` annotation indicates that the class has @Bean definition methods. So Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.

`@bean` annotation is applied on a method to specify that it returns a bean to be managed by Spring context. Spring Bean annotation is usually declared in Configuration classes methods.
```

### 3. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
```
1. Controller Based: We can define exception handler methods in our controller classes. All we need is to annotate these methods with `@ExceptionHandler` annotation. This annotation takes Exception class as argument.

2. Global Exception Handler: we can use `@ControllerAdvice` annotation with any class to define our global exception handler. The handler methods in Global Controller Advice is same as Controller based exception handler methods and used when controller class is not able to handle the exception.

3. HandlerExceptionResolver: we can implement `HandlerExceptionResolver` interface to create global exception handler.
```

### 4. How do you do the validations in Spring?
```
1. Import `javax.validation` and `hibernate-validator` dependencies to the project
2. Add validation Rule to `payload`
3. Add `@valid` annotation to controller to apply the Rule
```

### 5. What is the actuator?
```
Spring Bootâ€™s `Actuator` dependency is used to monitor and manage the Spring web application. We can use it to monitor and manage the application with the help of HTTP endpoints or with the JMX.
```
