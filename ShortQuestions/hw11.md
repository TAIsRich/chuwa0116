##1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
####Answer:
    The answer is in the /ShortQuestions/annotations.md.

##2. What is MVC pattern?
####Answer:
    Spring MVC is a web framework built on the Servlet API and included in the Spring framework. It inclues Model, View, 
    and Controller.
    1)Model: Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC application to 
    another. Controller populates the model with data from a form or a database or a web service. The controller passes 
    the model to the front controller which forwards it to the view resolver. The view template displays the data in the model.
    2)View(template): Spring MVC supports a number of view templates. The most commonly used are JSP or JSTL (JSP Standard 
    Tag Library). Other view templates like Thymeleaf, Groovy, Velocity, and FreeMarker etc., can also be plugged in.
    View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. If, say, the model contains 
    a list of players, the view template can create a table to display that list. In most cases a view template is a JSP page 
    that provides data to the user.
    3)Controller: The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. Controllers contain the business logic 
    of the application. They also handle requests and perform marshalling/unmarshalling. The function of the controller is 
    to handle a user request. The incoming request may be handled in different ways like reading form data, processing it 
    in some way, storing data in a database, or retrieving data from a web service etc. The controller places the data in 
    the model which, simply put, is a container for the data. The controller returns the model (containing data) back 
    to the front controller.

##3. What is Front-Controller?
####Answer:
    Front Controller is a single handler that handles all types of requests for an application, which can be a Web-based 
    or desktop-based application. In Spring MVC, DispatcherServlet acts like a Front-Controller.

##4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
####Answer:
    1) The DispatcherServlet is an implementation of the front-end controller design pattern, provides a centralized point 
    of access to Spring Web MVC and is responsible for delegating responsibilities, and integrates seamlessly with the 
    Spring IOC container to reap all the benefits of Spring. DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and 
    boilerplate tasks and focus on useful business logic, including mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method,
    parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or domain object, model-view-controller interact,
    and generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.
    2)Flow: When Spring WebServer receives an Http Request, it sends the request to the DispatcherServlet for processing -> 
    DispatcherServlet calls HandlerMapper with this request -> HanlerMapper will find the corresponding Controller and method 
    and return to dispactherServlet -> dispatcherServlet will call the method corresponding to the Controller, which will 
    trigger the call service, repository and database. -> The result (ModelAndView) is then returned through the Controller. 
    It usually returns a view name, a string like list-customers. The data is going to be set into the Model. -> DispatcerServlet 
    calls View Resolver with view name, and View Resolver will help us find view template, such as list-customers.jsp. -> 
    Now that with a view template and a data model, we can call View engine to help us put the data into the view templatel 
    and convert it to pure HTML -> This HTML is what the front end displays and ultimately returns to the browser.

##5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowledge)
####Answer:
    1)JSP(Java Server Page) is an extension of Servlet, its role is to simplify the creation and maintenance of web sites. 
    JSP page supports both HTML language and java support javaScript, so the function is more powerful, but the essence 
    of jsp is a Servlet, is also a Java class. There are two ways to introduce: first way is static introduction, with which
    No matter how many pages are imported, only one.java file is generated and the content of the imported page is directly 
    added to the imported page. It is with high efficiency, high coupling and low flexibility. The seconod way is Dynamic Introduction,
    in this way, how mant pages are introduced, and finally the sum of the introduced and introduced pages is generated. It is
    low efficiency, low coupling and high flexibility. The emergence of JSP makes it possible to effectively separate HTML and
    business logic code in Web development. Typically JSP is only responsible for generating dynamic HTML documents, and the 
    business logic is implemented by other Java components such as Javabean. JSP can access these components through scriptlets.
    And note When the browser sends a request ending in.jsp, it will be intercepted by the jsp engine configured on the server. 
    After the interception, the corresponding.java file and the compiled.class file will be generated in the work directory of
    the server, and then the _jspService method of the.class file will be executed finally. This means every time you enter the 
    browser and make a request, it automatically generates a new.java file and.class file, so you don't need to restart the server
    after modify JSP page.
    2)The ModelAndView class is used to store the processed result data and the view that displays that data. Model stands 
    for model, and View stands for view. ModelAndView is used for background and front-end page interaction, redirection and 
    forwarding to the specified page, and saving the data and rendering it to the page. And the way ModelAndView work is that
    the method return value in the Controller layer is written as ModelAndView -> creating a new ModelAndView within the method,
    -> assigning values to ModelAndView -> return ModelAndView. To be more specific, the way it returns the view is that 
    a ModelAndView can only return one html page. All you need to do is give ModelAndView the name of the html page. For example, 
    if I want to open the home.html page: ModelAndView.setViewName(" home "). And the way iit carrys data is that 
    it has a bunch of functions, and the best one is addObject(name,object), which gives you a name for the object that 
    you want to pass to the front end, and the front end gets that object based on the name that you gave it. Note that 
    it can carry a lot of data without repeating name.

##6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就⾏。)
####Answer:
    In a narrow sense, a Servlet is an interface implemented by the Java language. In a broad sense, a Servlet is any class 
    that implements the Servlet interface. In general, people will understand a Servlet as the latter. There are three ways 
    to implement servlets, inclduing implementing the Servlet interface, inheriting GenericServlet and inheriting HttpServlet.
    1)GenericServlet
    2)HttpServlet: In most network applications, browsers access server resources through HTTP, and servlets written
    in general are mainly applied to HTTP requests and responses. In order to quickly develop servlets applied to HTTP,
    Sun provides us with HttpServlet to create HTTP servlets suitable for Web sites.

##7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
####Answer:
    1)Apache: Apache can run on almost any widely used computer platform. It is one of the most popular Web server software 
    because it is widely used across platforms and security. It is fast, reliable, and extensible with a simple API to compile 
    Perl/Python and other interpreters into the server. Apache only supports static web pages. The advantages of Apache is 
    capability of Supporting more modules, more functions, strong running stability, capability of Supporting  PHP module and 
    no need for installing other redundant components to realize the parsing of php dynamic pages.
    2)Apache Tomcat: Tomcat is a Servlet container developed by Apache, which can support for servlets and JSP, and provide
    some special functions as a Web server, such as Tomcat management and control platform, security domain management and Tomcat valve.
    It is a lightweighted application server.
    3)Jetty: Jetty is an open source servlet container that provides the runtime environment for Java-based web content 
    such as JSPS and servlets. Jetty is written in the Java language, and its API is distributed as a set of JAR packages. 
    Developers can instantiate the Jetty container as an object, which can quickly provide network and web connectivity for some 
    standalone Java applications. It's a very scalable and flexible application Server. It has a basic data model, and that 
    data model is called a Handler, and all the components that can be extended can be added to the server as a Handler, 
    and Jetty manages that Handler. Furthermore, it is designed as a servlet container that can be embedded into other Java code.
    That is, the development team provides Jetty as a set of Jar files, so you can instantiate the servlet container as an object 
    in your own code and manipulate the container object.
    4)Jboss: JBoss is an open source enterprise-class Java middleware system for implementing SOA-based enterprise applications 
    and services, and J2EE-based open source application server. The JBoss code is licensed under the LGPL and can be used for free 
    in any commercial application. JBoss is a container and server that manages EJBs and supports the EJB 1.1, EJB 2.0, and EJB3 specifications.
    However, the JBoss core service does not include a WEB container that supports servlets/JSPS, hence it is typically used 
    with Tomcat or Jetty bindings. However, it has a unified class loader that enables hot deployment and hot unloading capabilities for applications.
    5)Nginx: Nginx is a high performance HTTP and reverse proxy web server that also provides IMAP/POP3/SMTP services. 
    It has strong concurrency resistance, small consumption of host resources and features of non-obstructive asynchronous 
    functionality. Nginx, on the other hand, is generally static (html and js) and does not have dynamic parsing function 
    itself, so it needs to configure other plug-ins or cooperate with other software to have dynamic function. It can also 
    implement load balancing. The load is the number of requests received by the Nginx reverse proxy server. The number of 
    requests is distributed to different servers according to certain rules, which is a balancing rule. Each request is 
    allocated to a different backend server in chronological order. If the backend server goes down, it can be automatically eliminated.
