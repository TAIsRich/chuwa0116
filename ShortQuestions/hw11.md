### 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
### 2.  What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
    Spring is a popular Java framework that provides a wide range of features and functionalities to develop enterprise-level applications. Spring Boot is a sub-project of Spring that focuses on making it easier to create Spring-based applications by simplifying and automating the configuration and setup process. The benefits of using Spring Boot include faster development time, reduced boilerplate code, easier setup and deployment, improved maintainability, and better compatibility with cloud technologies.
### 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
    IOC (Inversion of Control) is a design pattern used in software development where the control of object creation and lifecycle is passed on to a container or framework. DI (Dependency Injection) is a sub-pattern of IOC, where the dependencies of an object are injected into it by the container or framework. The benefits of using IOC and DI include improved modularity, flexibility, and testability.
### 4.  What is  @CompnonentScan?
    @ComponentScan is an annotation used to specify the packages that Spring should scan for components, such as Controllers, Services, and Repositories. By default, Spring will scan the package of the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
### 5.  How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
    In XML configuration, you can use the context:component-scan element to specify the base package(s) to scan for components. In annotation-based configuration, you can use the @ComponentScan annotation with a list of package names or base package classes as the value.

### 6.  What is  @SpringbootApplication?
    @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that combines several other annotations, including @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It is typically used to annotate the main class of a Spring Boot application.
### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
    There are several ways to define a bean in Spring:
    Using XML configuration with the <bean> element
    Using annotation-based configuration with the @Bean annotation
    Using component scanning with the @Component, @Controller, @Service, or @Repository annotations
    Using Java-based configuration with the @Configuration and @Bean annotations
### 8.  What is default bean name for  @Component and  @Bean?
    The default bean name for the @Component annotation is the uncapitalized class name, e.g. "myComponent". The default bean name for the @Bean annotation is the name of the method, e.g. "createMyBean".
### 9.  What is the difference between  @component and  @service,@repository?
    The @Component annotation is a general-purpose stereotype annotation used to mark a class as a Spring component. The @Service and @Repository annotations are specializations of @Component used to mark classes that provide business services or data access services, respectively.
### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
    @Autowired
    @Resource
    @Inject
    @Value
### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    The three types of dependency injection are constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection. Constructor injection is generally considered the preferred approach, as it enforces a clear contract between the bean and its dependencies, and enables immutability and testability.
### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
    To set a bean as primary, you can use the @Primary annotation. If no primary bean is defined, Spring will use the bean with the highest priority (i.e. the one with the lowest order value or the one defined first in the configuration).
### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
    BeanFactory and ApplicationContext are both interfaces in the Spring framework that define a container for managing beans. BeanFactory is a basic interface for accessing and managing beans, while ApplicationContext is a more advanced interface that extends BeanFactory and provides additional features such as internationalization, event propagation, and resource loading.
### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
    Singleton: A single instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application context.
    Prototype: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
    Request: A new instance of the bean is created for each HTTP request (web applications only).
    Session: A single instance of the bean is created for each HTTP session (web applications only).
    Global session: A single instance of the bean is created for each global HTTP session (portlet applications only).
### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
```
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <constructor-arg ref="dependencyBean" />
    <property name="property1" value="value1" />
    <property name="property2" ref="anotherBean" />
</bean>

```
