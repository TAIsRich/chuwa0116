#### 2. What is MVC pattern?
- MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software design pattern commonly used in web and application development. The MVC pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. 
- The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the application state, including data validation, storage, and retrieval. 
- The View represents the user interface of the application, which presents the data to the user and provides them with a way to interact with the application. 
- The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, receiving input from the user and passing it on to the Model for processing. It is also responsible for updating the View based on changes in the Model.

#### 3. What is Front-Controller?
- In the Front-Controller pattern, a single controller is responsible for handling all requests and coordinating the processing of the application. The controller acts as a mediator between the client and the application, receiving requests, and determining how they should be handled. It then dispatches the request to the appropriate handler, which may be a specific action or a set of actions.

#### 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
- DispatcherServlet is a key component of the Spring Web MVC framework, which implements the Front-Controller design pattern. It is responsible for managing the request-response cycle of a web application and dispatching requests to the appropriate handlers. 
- When a client sends a request to a web application, the request is intercepted by the DispatcherServlet. The DispatcherServlet then examines the request and determines which handler should be responsible for processing it. This is typically done by analyzing the URL, parameters, and headers of the request.

#### 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView?(please google to have a basic knowlege)
- JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used in web development that allows the creation of dynamic web pages using Java code. JSP pages are similar to HTML pages but can contain Java code snippets that are executed on the server-side before the page is sent to the client's web browser.

#### 6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间， 知道servlet的名字就行。)
- HttpServlet - This is a class that extends the GenericServlet class and provides a framework for handling HTTP requests. 
- Filter - This is a component that intercepts requests and responses to provide additional functionality such as logging, authentication, and data compression.

#### 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
- Google Web Server (GWS) - This is a custom web server developed by Google for serving content from its various services, including Google Search and YouTube. 
- Tomcat - This is a popular open-source web server and servlet container that is commonly used for running Java-based web applications.
