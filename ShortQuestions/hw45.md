## 2.What is the authentication?
- The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) is a set of application program interfaces (APIs) that can determine the identity of a user or computer attempting to run Java code and ensure that the entity has the right to execute the functions requested
## 4.What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
- Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.
## 5.What is HTTP Session?
- HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
## 6.What is Cookie?
- Cookies can be used to remember information about the user in order to show relevant content to that user over time. For example, a web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last used to log into a website, so that it may be filled in automatically the next time the user logs in.
## 7.What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
- Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information. Sessions are server-side files that contain user data. Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user. When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over.
## 8.How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
- Because HTTP protocols are stateless, and in order to maintain a state, we need session and cookie to preserve related user information.
## 9.What is JWT?
- What is JWT (JSON Web Token)? JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object. It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP)
## 10.What is the spring security filter?
- Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required. The ordering of the filters is important as there are dependencies between them.
## 11.describe how do JWT work
- JWT authentication is a token-based stateless authentication mechanism. It is popularly used as a client-side-based stateless session, this means the server doesn't have to completely rely on a data store (or) database to save session information. JWTs can be encrypted, but they are typically encoded & signed.
## 12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password
- Yes, it's the PasswordEncoder interface, implemented by BCryptPasswordEncoder to encoder our password.
## 13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?AuthenticationFilter?
## 14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
- Disadvantages: 1. Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 2. Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.
## 15. how to get value from application.properties?
`@Value("${my.property}")
private String myProperty;`
## 16.What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
- configure(HttpSecurity http): configures how the HTTP request are handled
- configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): configures how the User are authenticated, through database or third-party provider
## 17.What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
- Spring authentication: is performed by a series of chained authentication providers, which can be configured to use different authentication mechanisms
- Spring authorization: is typically performed by a series of chained authorization rules, which can be configured to use different access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control
