### 1. What is the authentication?         

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user who is trying to access a specific resource or service on the web.      

Typically, the authentication process involves the user submitting a set of credentials, such as a username and password, to the web application. The web application then checks these credentials against a database of authorized users to verify their authenticity. If the user's credentials are validated successfully, they are granted access to the requested resource or service.       

There are different methods and technologies used for web application authentication, including session-based authentication, token-based authentication, and OAuth. Some web applications may also use multi-factor authentication, which requires additional forms of verification beyond a username and password, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or an app.       

Effective authentication is critical to the security of web applications, as it helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. Therefore, it is essential for web application developers to implement robust and secure authentication mechanisms to protect their applications and users.       

### 2. What is the authorization?     

Authorization in web applications is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions and privileges to access a specific resource or perform a particular action within the application.     

Once a user has been authenticated, the web application must determine what actions the user is authorized to perform. This is typically based on the user's role or group membership, as defined in the application's security policy. For example, a user with the role of "administrator" may have access to certain administrative features that are not available to regular users.     

Authorization is often implemented using access control lists (ACLs), which define which users or groups have access to specific resources or actions within the application. Access control can be defined at the level of the application, the server, or the database, depending on the specific needs of the application.     

Effective authorization is essential to the security of web applications, as it ensures that users can only access the resources and perform the actions that they are authorized to do. Properly implementing authorization mechanisms can help prevent data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and other security threats.      

### 3. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?     

Authentication and authorization are two related but distinct concepts in computer security.     

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It involves verifying that the user or system is who they claim to be, typically by checking a set of credentials, such as a username and password, against a database of authorized users. The goal of authentication is to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access protected resources.     

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what a user or system is allowed to do once they have been authenticated. It involves verifying that the authenticated user or system has the necessary permissions and privileges to access a specific resource or perform a particular action within the system. The goal of authorization is to ensure that authenticated users or systems can only access the resources and perform the actions that they are authorized to do.     

In summary, authentication verifies the identity of a user or system, while authorization determines what actions the authenticated user or system is allowed to perform. Both authentication and authorization are important components of computer security and are often used together to protect sensitive data and resources.      

### 4. What is HTTP Session?     

HTTP Session is a mechanism used in web applications to maintain state between a server and a client. When a user interacts with a web application, the application may need to maintain some state information about the user's session, such as preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication status.

HTTP Session allows the server to store this state information in a session object, which is associated with a unique identifier, known as a session ID. The session ID is typically stored in a cookie on the client-side, which is sent with each subsequent request from the client to the server.

The server can use the session ID to retrieve the session object and access the stored state information. The session object is typically stored in memory on the server-side, but it can also be stored in a database or other persistent storage for scalability and fault tolerance.

HTTP Session is an important component of many web applications, as it allows the server to maintain state information across multiple HTTP requests from a single client. This can be used to implement features such as user authentication, shopping carts, and session timeouts. However, the use of HTTP Session can also introduce security vulnerabilities, such as session hijacking and session fixation, if not implemented correctly. Therefore, it is important to use secure session management techniques to protect the session data and prevent unauthorized access.      

### 5. What is Cookie?    

A cookie is a small text file that a web server sends to a web client (such as a browser) and that is stored on the client's computer. Cookies are used to maintain state information between a web server and a client, enabling web applications to store and retrieve information about the user's preferences, login status, or other data.     

Cookies can be created, read, and modified by both the web server and the client. When a client requests a web page from a server, the server can include one or more cookies in the response, which are then stored by the client's browser. The next time the client makes a request to the same server, the client's browser will include the cookie(s) in the request, allowing the server to retrieve the stored information.      

Cookies can be either "session cookies" or "persistent cookies". Session cookies are stored in the client's browser only until the session ends, which typically occurs when the user closes their browser. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, are stored on the client's computer for a longer period of time, even after the session ends. Persistent cookies can be used to remember a user's login information or to track their browsing behavior.      

Cookies are widely used in web applications to maintain state information, personalize content, and track user behavior. However, cookies can also introduce security vulnerabilities, such as session hijacking and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if not implemented correctly. Therefore, it is important to use secure cookie management techniques to protect the cookie data and prevent unauthorized access.      

### 6. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?      

Session and cookie are two related but distinct mechanisms used in web applications to maintain state between a server and a client.    

A session is a server-side mechanism that allows the server to maintain state information about a client's interactions with a web application. When a client connects to a web application, the server creates a session object that is associated with the client. The server stores session data in the session object, which can be accessed and modified by the server as needed. The session is typically identified by a unique session ID, which is passed between the client and the server in each request and response.     

A cookie, on the other hand, is a client-side mechanism that allows a web server to store and retrieve state information on the client's computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on the client's computer and is associated with a specific web server. The server sends the cookie to the client, and the client's web browser stores it on the client's computer. The cookie can contain data that is used to personalize the user's experience or to track their behavior on the site.     

The main differences between session and cookie are:     

1. Location: Session is stored on the server-side, while the cookie is stored on the client-side.      
2. Data storage: The session can store large amounts of data, while cookies have size limitations.     
3. Lifetime: Sessions are generally short-lived, and they expire after a period of inactivity, while cookies can have a longer lifespan and can be set to expire after a certain time.     
4. Security: Sessions are generally considered more secure than cookies, as they are not vulnerable to client-side attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.      
In summary, while both sessions and cookies are used to maintain state information between a server and a client, they differ in terms of location, data storage, lifetime, and security. Which mechanism to use depends on the specific needs of the web application.         

### 7. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?      

In web applications, session and cookie can be used to maintain user information across the application.      

To use session to maintain user information, the server creates a session object for each user when they log in or start a session. The session object can be used to store user-specific data, such as user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication status. The session ID is typically stored in a cookie on the client-side, which is sent with each subsequent request from the client to the server. The server can use the session ID to retrieve the session object and access the stored data. Session data is typically destroyed when the user logs out or when the session times out.      

To use a cookie to maintain user information, the server can set a cookie on the client-side when the user logs in or starts a session. The cookie can contain data that is used to personalize the user's experience or to track their behavior on the site. The client's web browser will then send the cookie back to the server with each subsequent request, allowing the server to retrieve the stored information. The cookie can have an expiration date, which determines how long the cookie will be stored on the client-side.      

To maintain user information across the application, the server can use a combination of session and cookie. For example, the server can use session to store sensitive user data, such as authentication status, and use cookie to store non-sensitive user data, such as user preferences. The use of session and cookie can help ensure that the user's data is stored securely and is accessible across different pages of the application.      

However, it is important to use secure session and cookie management techniques to protect the data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes setting appropriate expiration dates, using secure transmission methods, and using secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data.       

### 8. What is JWT?    

JWT stands for JSON Web Token, which is an open standard for creating and transmitting JSON-based tokens between parties. JWTs are used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.     

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header specifies the algorithm used to sign the token, while the payload contains the claims or data that are being transmitted. The signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token.     

JWTs are typically used in scenarios where a user needs to be authenticated and authorized to access a protected resource, such as a web application or API. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT that contains the user's identity and any necessary authorization data, such as roles or permissions. The server signs the JWT using a secret key, and sends the JWT to the client. The client can then use the JWT to access protected resources by sending the token with each subsequent request.     

One of the main advantages of JWT is that it is stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store session information about the user. This can simplify server-side architecture and improve scalability. Additionally, JWTs can be used across multiple domains, which can be useful in distributed environments.     

However, it is important to use secure JWT management techniques to protect the data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes using secure transmission methods, setting appropriate expiration dates, and using secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data.      

### 9. What is the spring security filter?       

Spring Security filter is a set of security components that provide authentication and authorization capabilities to Spring-based applications. The Spring Security framework is designed to help developers easily implement security features such as user authentication, access control, and session management in their applications.     

Spring Security filter works by intercepting requests and responses to and from the application and performing security checks to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested resource. The filter chain is configured in the application's web.xml or servlet container initialization code, and it can be customized by developers to meet the specific security requirements of the application.      

The Spring Security filter is a chain of filters that perform specific security tasks, such as:      

Authentication: This filter checks whether the user is authenticated and redirects them to the login page if necessary.
Authorization: This filter checks whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.    
Session Management: This filter manages user sessions, including session timeout and invalidation.     
Logout: This filter logs out the user and invalidates their session.
Remember-me: This filter allows users to be automatically logged in if they have previously authenticated.     
The Spring Security filter can be extended or customized to meet the specific needs of the application, such as integrating with an external authentication provider or adding additional security checks. Overall, Spring Security filter provides a powerful and flexible way to implement security features in Spring-based applications.      

### 10. decribe how do JWT work      

When a user logs in or starts a session, the server creates a JWT containing the user's identity and any necessary authorization data.
The JWT is comprised of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header specifies the algorithm used to sign the token, while the payload contains the claims or data that are being transmitted.    
The JWT is signed using a secret key known only to the server. The signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token.
The JWT is then sent to the client, which can store it in memory or in local storage.    
The client can use the JWT to access protected resources by sending the token with each subsequent request. The token is typically included in the Authorization header of the request, using the Bearer scheme.    
The server receives the request and extracts the JWT from the Authorization header. The server then verifies the authenticity of the JWT by checking the signature and decoding the payload.
If the JWT is valid, the server grants access to the requested resource. If the JWT is invalid, the server returns an error message or redirects the user to a login page.     

### 11. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?      

BCryptPasswordEncoder: This is a popular password encoder in the Spring Security framework that uses the BCrypt hashing algorithm.      
Argon2PasswordEncoder: This is a password encoder that uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm, which is designed to be resistant to GPU-based attacks.      
PBKDF2PasswordEncoder: This is a password encoder that uses the PBKDF2 algorithm, which is an established standard for password-based key derivation.      
SCryptPasswordEncoder: This is a password encoder that uses the SCrypt key derivation function, which is designed to be resistant to both CPU and memory-based attacks.      

### 12. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider? AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?

UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, and AuthenticationFilter are all components of the Spring Security framework used for implementing authentication and authorization in web applications.     

UserDetailsService: This is an interface that is used to retrieve user details from a persistent data store, such as a database or LDAP directory. The UserDetailsService interface is typically implemented in the application code to provide user details to the authentication provider.     
AuthenticationProvider: This is an interface that is used to authenticate a user's credentials. The AuthenticationProvider interface is typically implemented in the application code to provide custom authentication logic. An AuthenticationProvider can be chained with other providers to form an AuthenticationProvider chain.     
AuthenticationManager: This is a component that manages the AuthenticationProvider chain and delegates authentication requests to the appropriate provider. The AuthenticationManager is responsible for authenticating a user's credentials and returning a fully authenticated Authentication object.     
AuthenticationFilter: This is a component that intercepts requests and performs authentication checks before allowing the request to proceed. The AuthenticationFilter is typically used to authenticate users using a standard authentication scheme, such as HTTP Basic or Form-based authentication. The AuthenticationFilter works in conjunction with the AuthenticationManager to authenticate the user's credentials.     
In summary, UserDetailsService is used to retrieve user details, AuthenticationProvider is used to authenticate the user's credentials, AuthenticationManager is used to manage the AuthenticationProvider chain and delegate authentication requests, and AuthenticationFilter is used to perform authentication checks on incoming requests. Together, these components provide a flexible and extensible way to implement authentication and authorization in Spring-based web applications.        

### 13. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?      

While HTTP Session provides a useful mechanism for maintaining state information between a server and a client in web applications, it can also have some disadvantages that need to be considered:      

Scalability: Because sessions are typically stored on the server-side, they can consume server resources and limit the scalability of the application. If many users are simultaneously accessing the application, the server may become overloaded and the application may become slow or unresponsive.      

Persistence: Session data is usually stored in memory on the server-side, which means that the data is lost if the server is restarted. This can cause users to lose their session state and require them to log in again.         

Security: Sessions can be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks if not implemented correctly. If an attacker can obtain a user's session ID, they can impersonate the user and access their session data.        

To overcome the disadvantages of Session, here are some solutions:      

Distributed caching: To address scalability issues, session data can be stored in a distributed cache, such as Redis or Memcached. This allows multiple servers to share the same session data, improving scalability and performance.      

Use persistent storage: To address persistence issues, session data can be stored in a persistent storage mechanism, such as a database or file system. This allows session data to survive server restarts and provide a more reliable user experience.      

Use secure session management techniques: To address security issues, it is important to use secure session management techniques, such as setting appropriate expiration dates, using secure transmission methods, and using secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data.      

Use stateless authentication: Stateless authentication mechanisms, such as JWTs, can be used instead of sessions to maintain user state. This can improve scalability and reduce server-side resource usage.      

Overall, while HTTP Session can provide a useful mechanism for maintaining state information in web applications, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages and to use appropriate solutions to address these issues.      

### 14. how to get value from application.properties?      

In a Spring-based application, the values from application.properties can be easily accessed by using the @Value annotation or the Environment class.     

Here is an example of using the @Value annotation to get a property value:      
```
@Value("${my.property}")
private String myProperty;
```

In this example, the @Value annotation is used to inject the value of the my.property property from the application.properties file into the myProperty field. The ${my.property} syntax is used to reference the property value.       

Here is an example of using the Environment class to get a property value:      

```
@Autowired
private Environment env;

public void someMethod() {
    String myProperty = env.getProperty("my.property");
    // Use the myProperty value here
}
```

In this example, the Environment class is autowired and used to retrieve the value of the my.property property from the application.properties file. The getProperty() method is used to retrieve the property value as a string.

Both of these approaches can be used to retrieve values from the application.properties file in a Spring-based application. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application and the developer's personal preference.        

### 15. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?     

In a Spring Security configuration class, the configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) methods have different roles in the authentication and authorization process:     

configure(HttpSecurity http): This method is used to configure the security settings for HTTP requests. It defines which URLs require authentication, which roles are required to access certain URLs, and which authentication mechanisms are used. This method typically includes a series of chained method calls that specify the security settings, such as authorizeRequests(), formLogin(), httpBasic(), and logout().       

For example, a typical configure(HttpSecurity http) method might look like this:      

```
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .formLogin()
            .loginPage("/login")
            .permitAll()
            .and()
        .logout()
            .permitAll();
}
```

In this example, the authorizeRequests() method is used to specify the access rules for different URLs, the formLogin() method is used to configure the form-based authentication, and the logout() method is used to configure the logout behavior.      

configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): This method is used to configure the authentication mechanism for the application. It defines how users are authenticated, such as via a database or an external authentication provider, and how the user details are retrieved. This method typically includes a series of chained method calls that specify the authentication settings, such as inMemoryAuthentication(), jdbcAuthentication(), ldapAuthentication(), and userDetailsService().       

For example, a typical configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method might look like this:      

```
@Autowired
public void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
    auth
        .inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user1").password("{noop}password1").roles("USER")
            .and()
            .withUser("user2").password("{noop}password2").roles("USER", "ADMIN");
}
```
In this example, the inMemoryAuthentication() method is used to configure an in-memory user store, and the withUser() method is used to define the users and their roles.      

Overall, configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) are both important methods in a Spring Security configuration class, with the former responsible for setting up the security settings for HTTP requests and the latter responsible for configuring the authentication mechanism.      

16. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?     

Spring Security is a powerful and flexible framework that provides authentication and authorization features for Spring-based web applications and APIs. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity and roles.     

In Spring Security, authentication is typically performed by a series of chained authentication providers, which can be configured to use different authentication mechanisms, such as in-memory authentication, database authentication, LDAP authentication, or external authentication providers. The authentication providers work together to authenticate a user's credentials and return a fully authenticated Authentication object, which can then be used for further authorization checks.     

Authorization in Spring Security is typically performed by a series of chained authorization rules, which can be configured to use different access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, method-level security, or expression-based access control. The authorization rules work together to grant or deny access to resources based on the user's identity and roles.      

Spring Security also provides additional features, such as session management, CSRF protection, and secure password storage, which can be used to improve the security of Spring-based applications.      

Overall, Spring Security provides a powerful and flexible way to implement authentication and authorization in Spring-based web applications and APIs, with support for a wide range of authentication and authorization mechanisms and a rich set of security features.
