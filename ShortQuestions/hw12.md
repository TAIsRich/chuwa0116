### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
- Spring is a lightweight open-source Java development framework.
- Spring Boot aims to reduce code length and provides developers with the easiest way to build an application.
#### Benfites of using SpringBoot including
-   Can be used to build standalone applications
-   No need to deploy WAR files
-   Doesn't require XML configuration
-   Embeds Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow directly
-   Offers production ready features
-   Easier to launch
-   Easier management and customization
### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
IOC stands for Inversion of Control, and DI stands for Dependency Injection
### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
Define where the spring need to scan the bean definations and generate the beans.
###  5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
   ```java
   ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean.xml");
   ```
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.chuwa.springbasic"})
   ```
### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
`@SpringBootApplication` is a Spring Boot annotation that is used to enable a variety of Spring Boot features in a Java application. It is a combination of three other annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
### 7. How many ways we can define a bean?
3 ways, Class, Method and XML
### 8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
the default bean name for `@Component` and `@Bean` is the name of the class with a lowercase first letter.
### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
@service and @repository are @component. It better for reader.
### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans  in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    Constructor Injection/Setter Injection/Field Injection
    Constructor injection is better, because it's safer and easy for read.
### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
    Priority: @Qualifier > @Primary > By Name > throw
### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
`BeanFactory` is a lightweight container suitable for small to medium-sized applications, while `ApplicationContext` is a more advanced container that provides additional functionality and support for larger and more complex applications.
### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
-  Singleton: This is the default scope in Spring, where only one instance of the bean is created per container. The same instance is returned every time the bean is requested.
-  Prototype: In this scope, a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested. This can be useful for beans that are stateful or need to be configured differently for each use.
### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
<constructor-arg value="myString" />
<constructor-arg value="42" />
</bean>
```
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="myDependency" ref="myDependencyBean" />
</bean>
<bean id="myDependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
```
