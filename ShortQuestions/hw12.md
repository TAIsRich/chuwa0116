1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
   annotaitons.md

2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?

   SpringBoot makes it easy to work with Spring
   framework. When using Spring framework, we have to take
   care of all the configuration ourselves like, for making a web
   application, DispatcherServlet, ViewResolver etc
   configurations are needed. SpringBoot solves this problem
   through a combination of Auto Configuration and Starter
   projects.

3. What is IOC and What is DI?

    IOC is Inversion of Control". It is a principle that suggests that control of a system's flow should be handed over to a framework or container, 
    rather than being hard-coded into the application. 
    This means that the framework or container is responsible for creating and managing instances of objects and controlling their lifecycles. 
    This can help to reduce dependencies between components and make the code more modular and maintainable.

    DI stands for "Dependency Injection". It is a technique that enables the implementation of the IOC principle. It involves passing dependencies of a class as constructor arguments or method parameters, rather than hard-coding them into the class itself.

4. What is @CompnonentScan?

   Define where the spring need to scan the bean definations and generate the beans.

5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?

    ```java
   ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean.xml");
   ```
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.chuwa.springbasic"})
   ```
6. What is @SpringbootApplication?

    @SpringbootApplication = @Configuration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan

7. How many ways wo can define a bean?

- Class level : 
```java
@Component
@Service
@Repository
@Controller
```
- Method level
```java
@Bean (used with @Configuration) togethee
```

- XML
```java
<bean id="dataNucleusChuwaNoComponent"
class="com.chuwa.springbasic.components.impl.DataNu
cleusChuwaNoComponent"></bean>
```

8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
    lower letter for class name or method name

9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
    
    @service and @repository are @component. It better for reader.

10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?

    - @Autowired By Type > By Name Priority: @Qualifier > @Primary > By Name > throw
      exception(NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException)
    - @Resource By Name > By Type
    - @Inject

11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
    in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
    
    Constructor Injection/Setter Injection/Field Injection
    Constructor injection is better, because it's safer and easy for read.

12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
    the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.

    Priority: @Qualifier > @Primary > By Name > throw

13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?

    Answer: The differences are:
- BeanFactory is the most basic version of IOC containers
  which should be preferred when memory consumption is
  critical whereas ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory,
  so you get all the benefits of BeanFactory plus some
  advanced features for enterprise applications
- BeanFactory instantiates beans on-demand i.e. when the
  method getBean(beanName) is called, it is also called
  Lazy initializer whereas ApplicationContext instantiates
  beans at the time of creating the container where bean
  scope is Singleton, so it is an Eager initializer
- BeanFactory only supports 2 bean scopes, singleton and
  prototype whereas ApplicationContext supports all bean
  scopes
- ApplicationContext automatically registers
  BeanFactoryPostProcessor and BeanPostProcessor at
  startup, whereas BeanFactory does not register these
  interfaces automatically
- Annotation based dependency injection is not supported
  by BeanFactory whereas ApplicationContext supports it
- If you are using plain BeanFactory, features like
  transactions and AOP will not take effect (not without
  some extra steps), even if nothing is wrong with the
  configuration whereas in ApplicationContext, it will work
- ApplicationContext provides additional features like
  MessageSource access (i18n or Internationalization) and
  Event Publication

14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.

Bean Scope :Basic(通⽤) Singleton / prototype

Web (只有web applicaiton⽤) Request / Session / Application / Websocket

15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
    configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml,
    and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old,
    I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
<constructor-arg value="myString" />
<constructor-arg value="42" />
</bean>
```
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="myDependency" ref="myDependencyBean" />
</bean>

<bean id="myDependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
```
