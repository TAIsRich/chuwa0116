##1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
####Answer:
    The answer is in the /ShortQuestions/annotations.md.

##2. What is the authentication?
####Answer:
    Authentication is the process of verifying a user or device before being allowed to access to a system. 
    In other words, authentication means confirming that a user is who they say they are. 

##3. What is the authorization?
####Answer:
    Authorization is generally defined and granted access to information security or computer security related resources, 
    especially access control. Whether the user has permission to access an API. can this user do this? For example, 
    common users cannot access the permission set to admin.

##4. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?
####Answer:
    1)In authentication process, the identity of users are checked for providing the access to the system, While in authorization 
    process, person’s or user’s authorities are checked for accessing the resources.
    2)In authentication process, users or persons are verified, while in authorization process, users or persons are validated.
    3)Authentication process is done before the authorization process.
    4)Authentication process needs usually user’s login details, while authorization process needs user’s privilege or security levels.
    5)Authentication determines whether the person is user or not, while authorization determines What permission user has.
    6)Generally, authentication process transmit information through an ID Token, while authorization process transmits information through
    an Access Token.

##5. What is HTTP Session?
####Answer:
    1)We can save the data that needs to be shared within a session to the Httpsession object. HttpSession is a class provided 
    by JavaWeb for session tracking. session is a server-side object, saved on the server side. And HttpSession is one of the 
    three domain objects of Servlet, which are request, session, and application(ServletContext)). So it also has setAttribute(), 
    getAttribute(), and removeAttribute() methods. Additionally, HttpSession underlying dependence on cookies, or URL rewriting.
    2)What HTTP Session does:
    1. Session range: The session range starts when a user accesses the server for the first time and ends when the user closes the browser.
    2. Session: Multiple continuous requests from a user to the server. The so-called continuity request is that the user does not close the browser in the middle of multiple requests.
    3. The server will create a session object for each client. Sessions are like client accounts on the server, which are saved by the server in a Map.
    4. Get the session object from the Servlet: HttpSession session = request.getSession().
    5. Jsp get session object: session is jsp built-in object, without creating can be used directly.
    6. session domain related methods:
```
void setAttribute(String name, Object value);
Object getAttribute(String name);
void removeAttribute(String name);
```

##6. What is Cookie?
####Answer:
    Cookie is a "small text file", which refers to the data (usually encrypted) stored on the user's local terminal in order 
    to identify the user's identity and conduct Session tracking on some websites. The information is temporarily or permanently 
    saved by the user's client computer. The working mechnism of Cookie is that after the first login, the server returns 
    some data (cookies) to the browser, and then the browser saves it locally. When the user sends the second request, 
    the cookie data stored in the last request will be automatically carried to the server. The server can judge the current 
    user through the data carried by the browser.

##7. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
####Answer:
    1)Cookie can be stored in the browser or on the local personal computer, and sessions can only be stored on the server.
    2)Session can store any java object, while cookie can only store String objects
    3)Session is more secure than Cookie. (Cookie has security risks, and can be attacked by interception or local files to find your cookie)
    4)Sessions occupy server performance. Hence, too many sessions increase the pressure of the server.
    5)The data saved by a single Cookie cannot exceed 4K, so many browsers limit a site to save a maximum of 20 cookies. 
    While the Session has no size limit and is related to the memory size of the server.

##8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the  application?
####Answer:
    There are two ways.
    1)Server Side Session: A session_id is stored via cookies, and the specific data is stored in the session. If the user 
    has logged in, the server saves a session_id in the cookie. This session_id is brought to the server when the user 
    requests the session again. The server obtains session data from the session library based on the session_id. You can 
    figure out who the user is, as well as some of the previously saved status information. 
    2)Client Side Session: The session data is encrypted and stored in cookies. 

##9. What is JWT?
####Answer:
    JWT(JSON Web Token) is an open Json-based standard (RFC 7519) that is implemented to pass declarations between network 
    application environments. The token is designed to be compact and secure, especially for single sign-on (SSO) scenarios 
    at distributed sites. The declaration of JWT is generally used to transfer the authenticated user identity information 
    between the identity provider and the service provider, so as to obtain resources from the resource server. It can also 
    add some additional declaration information required by other business logic. The token can also be directly used for 
    authentication and can also be encrypted. JWT is made up of three pieces of information(header + payload + signature), 
    and these three pieces of information are used as text.

##10. What is the spring security filter?
####Answer:
    What Spring Security itself does is register a series of Filters in the Spring container that execute their defined 
    processing when they detect URL requests that satisfy the conditions. The ordering of the filters is important as there
    are dependencies between them. The Security work entrusted to springsecurityFilterChain to complete various functions. 
    At the bottom of Spring Security, authentication and authorization requests are managed through a series of filters, 
    forming a core chain of filters. Each Filter has its own function, and the function of each Filter is associated, 
    which will be automatically configured after the project is started. One of the most core is BasicAuthenticationFilter,
    the Filter is used to authenticate the user identity.

##11. describe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图， 26页)
####Answer:
    Step1: Post/authenticate with username and password(Client -> Server).
    Step2: Validate the username and password, and generate the JWT using secret key(On the Server side).
    Step3: Return the generated JWT(Server -> Client), and saved on client side in either local storage or cookie.
    Step4: Get/hello with JWT in the HTTP Header(Client -> Server).
    Step5: Validate JWT using secret key.(on the Server side)
    Step6: Return the response.(Server -> Client)

##12. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
####Answer:
    There are several algorithms to encode Password, like MD5, Base64, RSA, AES and etc..
    In Spring Security, we use BCryptPasswordEncoder. BCryptPasswordEncoder implements the PasswordEncoder interface, and 
    is needed to implement its encryption and password matching methods. The steps to use it is as following:
    1)The encryption is very simple. After creating the BCryptPasswordEncoder class, call its encode method, pass the password 
    to be encrypted as a parameter to get the encrypted password, set the password to the encrypted password and then perform 
    new operations.
    2)During password matching, for example, login operation, you can configure the password in the configuration file 
    instead of writing the matching method. Then you just need to reference this encryption method in the authentication 
    manager's user authentication, and it will match the password itself upon login. Note for user authentication, it is needed
    to create a class to implement the UserDetailsService and its loadUserByUsername method, which will determine the user name, 
    password, permission set, etc.

##13. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
####Answer:
    1)UserDetailService: UserDetails describe the user in Spring Security, and UserDetailsService defines the query operation 
    for UserDetails. In fact, the authentication operation has been achieved by the framework. It just needs you to provide 
    me with access to information. So it defines an interface, lets you implement it, and then injects it. The framework 
    provides a UserDetailsService interface to load user information. To customize the implementation, the user can implement 
    a CustomUserDetailsService class and inject UserService and AuthorityService from your application into this class. 
    The user gets the user information and permission information. Then, in the loadUserByUsername method, construct a 
    User object (the frame's class) and return.
    2)AuthenticationProvider: The AuthenticationProvider is the top-level interface of the user-defined identity authentication process. 
    Its role is only used to authenticate. When we do not specify a related object AuthenticationProvider, Spring Security used 
    the DaoAuthenticationProvider by default for validation, Which is the most common way to use an account name or password.
    3)AuthenticationManager: it defines the authentication method authenticate() for the authentication management interface class.
    ProviderManager implements the interface AuthenticationManager for the authentication management class, and entrusts the 
    authentication provider with the authentication qualification to authenticate().
    4) AuthenticationFilter: It is a component that authenticates an HTTP request. It adopts the responsibility chain design mode. 
    A web request will pass through a filter chain. Authentication and authorization will be completed in the process of passing 
    through the filter chain. These exceptions are then handled by the exception handler.

##14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
####Answer:
    1)disadvantage: 
    1.Occupying server resources: the storage of session needs space, and the transmission of session is generally transmitted 
    through cookies or url rewriting, which may greatly increase the cost of the server.
    2.no distributed architecture to support horizontal scaling: if you use a single server, this pattern is perfectly fine. 
    However, if it is a server cluster or service-oriented cross-domain architecture, a unified session database is required 
    to store session data for sharing so that each server under load balancing can properly authenticate users.
    3. due to being preserved in various forms, it is inconvenient
    4.Overuse results in unreadable and unmaintainable code
    5.session is commonly used for file storage and has poor performance
    2)use Token instead.

##15. how to get value from application.properties?
####Answer:
    using @Value annotation.
```
in application.properties:
app.jwt-secret = JWTSecretKey

can use @Value as following:
@Value("${app.jwt-secret}")
private String jwtSecret;
```

##16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
####Answer:
    1)role of configure(HttpSecurity http): The configure(HttpSecurity http) method defines which URL paths should be 
    protected and which should not. Specifically, the "/" and "/ home" paths are configured to not require any authentication. 
    All other paths must be authenticated. Used to configure HttpSecurity. HttpSecurity is used to build a security filter 
    chain SecurityFilterChain. The SecurityFilterChain is eventually injected into the core filter
    2)role of configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): used to configure the AuthenticationManager, which is used for 
    all userDetails, including the PasswordEncoder password machine.

##17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
####Answer:
    The main functions of Spring Security are Authentication, Authorization and Attack protection. Authentication is a credential that authenticates the identity 
    (such as username/user ID and password), through which the system knows that you are you, meaning that you exist as a user.
    So, Authentication is called identity/user authentication. Authorization occurs after Authentication. Authorization basically 
    controls the access to the system. For example, only users with specific permissions can access certain resources, such as admin. 
    Some operations on system resources, such as deleting, adding, and updating, can only be accessed by specific users.
    And common Http authentication and authorization using form-based authentication (Cookie&Session) and JWT (Json Web Token) based authentication
