## 2.  What is MVC pattern?
- Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

## 3.  What is Front-Controller? 
- A Front Controller is a typical structure in web applications that receives requests and delegates their processing to other components in the application

## 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
- DispatcherServlet acts as the Front Controller for Spring-based web applications. It handles an incoming HttpRequest, delegates the request, and processes that request according to the configured HandlerAdapter interfaces that have been implemented within the Spring application along with accompanying annotations specifying handlers, controller endpoints, and response objects.

- DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on useful business logic:
    - Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method
    - Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or domain objects
    - Model-view-controller interaction
    - Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.




## 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)
- JSP stands for Java Server Pages, and it's used to create dynamically changed web pages based on HTML, XML or other document types. 

- ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. The view is resolved by a ViewResolver object; the model is data stored in a Map.

## 6.  Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)

   - HttpServlet: This is an abstract class that extends the GenericServlet class and provides methods for handling HTTP-specific requests and responses.

   - Filter: A filter is a Java class that is used to intercept and process requests and responses before they are handled by a servlet or JSP page.

   - RequestDispatcher: This is an interface that allows a servlet to forward a request to another resource (such as another servlet or JSP page) for processing.


## 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
- Apache 
- Tomcat
- NGINX
- LiteSpeed


## 8.  clone this repo, and run it in you local.
a. https://github.com/TAIsRich/springmvc5-demo

b. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in 
the slides.

c.  find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list 
some API.

d.  remeber to create a database for this project

e.  all details in the slides.
