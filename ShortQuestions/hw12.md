# HW12
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benefits of using Srpingboot?
```
Spring is a lightweight framework that offers an elaborate environment for robust programming and configuration model for Java-based applications.

Spring Boot is a java-based framework that is best for creating stand-alone, Spring-based applications in a short period.

Spring Boot reduces lots of development time and increases productivity. It avoids writing lots of boilerplate Code, Annotations and XML Configuration. It is very easy to integrate Spring Boot Application with its Spring Ecosystem like Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring Data, Spring Security etc.
```

### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
```
IOC (Inversion of Control) is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework.

DI (Dependency Injection) is a pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies.
```

### 4. What is `@ComponentScan`?
```
@Configuration annotation is used to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. @ComponentScan without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.
```

### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotation?
```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean.xml");
```
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.chuwa.springbasic"})
```

### 6. What is `@SpringbootApplication`?
```
@SpringBootApplication annotation is used to mark a configuration class that declares one or more @Bean methods and also triggers auto-configuration and component scanning
```

### 7. How many ways we can define a bean?
```
There are three different ways in which you can define a Spring bean:
1. annotating your class with the stereotype @Component annotation (or its derivatives)
2. writing a bean factory method annotated with the @Bean annotation in a custom Java configuration class
3. declaring a bean definition in an XML configuration file
```

### 8. What is default bean name for `@Component` and `@Bean`?
```
@Component: Spring will register beans under the name of the class name.

@Bean: Spring will register beans using the class name of the bean class.
```

### 9. What is the difference between `@component` and `@service`, `@repository`?
```
@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
@Service annotates classes at the service layer. 
@Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
```

### 10. How many annotations we can use to inject the bean?
```
@Autowired
@Resource
@Inject
```

### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
```
1. Constructor Injection 
2. Setter Injection
3. Interface Injection 
Constructor injection is a better way since it's safer and easy for read.
```

### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring pick one bean to inject if no primary.
```
Use @Primary to annotate which bean to give  precedence to if there are two or more possible candidates.
Use @Qualifier together with the name of the specific implementation we want to use, we can avoid ambiguity when Spring finds multiple beans of the same type.
```

### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
```
1. BeanFactory is a fundamental container that provides the basic functionality for managing beans, while ApplicationContext is an advanced container that extends the BeanFactory that provides all basic functionality and adds some advanced features.
2. BeanFactory is suitable to build standalone applications, while ApplicationContext is suitable to build Web applications, integration with AOP modules, ORM and distributed 
applications.
3. BeanFactory supports only Singleton and Prototype bean scopes, while ApplicationContext supports all types of bean scopes such as Singleton, Prototype, Request, Session etc.
```

### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
```
1. singleton - only one instance of the spring bean will be created for the spring container. This is the default spring bean scope. While using this scope, make sure bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues.
2. prototype – A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested from the spring container.
3. request – This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.
4. session – A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.
5. global-session – This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.
```

### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
<constructor-arg value="myString" />
<constructor-arg value="42" />
</bean>
```
```java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="myDependency" ref="myDependencyBean" />
</bean>
<bean id="myDependencyBean" class="com.example.MyDependency" />
```
