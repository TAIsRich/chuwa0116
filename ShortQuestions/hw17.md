### 1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md
Please check ShortQuestions/annotations.md file

### 2. what is selenium(YouTube)?
```
Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.
```

### 3. what is cucumber(youtuebe)?
```
Cucumber is a tool used for behavior-driven development (BDD) to write acceptance tests for web applications. It uses the Gherkin language to describe the expected behavior of the application in plain English.
```

### 4. what is JMeter(youtube)?
```
Apache JMeter is an open source Java application designed to load test functional behavior and gauge software performance. Originally designed for testing web apps, it has since expanded to include other test-related functions. Additionally, JMeter can simulate a heavy load on a server by creating thousands of virtual concurrent users to the web server.
```

### 5. What is unit-test?
```
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
```

### 6. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
```
A JUnit test case can contain many test methods. Each method identified as a test will be executed within the JUnit test lifecycle. The lifecycle consists of three pieces: setup, test and teardown, all executed in sequence.
```

### 7. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
```
Yes, the @BeforeAll method should be a static method because it is called before any instance of the test class is created.
```

### 8. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?
```
Mockito is a framework of choice for most of the java based projects. It is easy to implement, read and understand.

Limitations: 
1. Its inability to mock static methods.
2. Constructors, private methods and final classes cannot be mocked.
```

### 9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
```
The @Mock annotation is used to create mock objects that can be used to replace dependencies in a test class.
The @InjectMocks annotation is used to create an instance of a class and inject the mock objects into it, allowing you to test the behavior of the class.
```

### 10. What is the stubbing?
```
Stubbing is a technique used in testing to create a fake implementation of a class or interface method. It is used to simulate specific behavior of the object being tested to verify if the object responds correctly to the behavior being tested.
```

### 11. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
```
Mockito ArgumentMatchers are used to match the arguments passed to a mock object during a test, and allows us flexible verification or stubbing.
```

### 12. what is Hamcrest Matchers
```
Hamcrest Matchers is a library that provides a set of matchers that can be used with testing frameworks like JUnit or Mockito. Hamcrest Matchers provide a way to write more expressive and readable test assertions, making it easier to understand what is being tested and what the expected result should be.
```

### 13. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
```
@Spy is an annotation used in Mockito to create a spy object, which is a real object that has been wrapped with a Mockito spy. A spy object behaves like a real object but also allows for behavior verification and mocking.

In mock, you are creating a complete mock or fake object while in spy, there is the real object and you just spying or stubbing specific methods of it. When using mock objects, the default behavior of the method when not stub is do nothing. While in spy objects, since it is a real method, when you are not stubbing the method, then it will call the real method behavior. If you want to change and mock the method, then you need to stub it.
```

Completed

### 15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.
