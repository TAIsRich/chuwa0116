## 1.  list all of the new annotations you learned to your annotations.md
## 2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
    Microservice architecture is an approach to building software applications as a suite of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function or task, and together they form a cohesive system. The architecture is composed of several components, including the individual microservices, API gateways, service registries, service mesh, and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. Commonly used tools and dependencies in microservices include Node.js, Spring Boot, Docker, AWS, and Azure.
## 3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
    Resilience patterns are design patterns that are used to improve the fault tolerance and resilience of distributed systems. They are designed to enable systems to continue functioning even in the face of failures or disruptions. Circuit breaker is a resilience pattern that is used to detect and respond to failures in remote services. It works by monitoring the status of remote services and opening the circuit when the service fails, thereby avoiding further requests to the failing service and allowing the system to recover. Once the service has recovered, the circuit is closed again, and requests can be forwarded to the service.

### a. https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices

#### 1. Write main features of Microservices.
    Decoupling: Within a system, services are largely decoupled. The application as a whole can therefore be easily constructed, altered, and scalable
    Componentization: Microservices are viewed as independent components that can easily be exchanged or upgraded
    Business Capabilities: Microservices are relatively simple and only focus on one service
    Team autonomy: Each developer works independently of each other, allowing for a faster project timeline
    Continuous Delivery: Enables frequent software releases through systematic automation of software development, testing, and approval
    Responsibility: Microservices are not focused on applications as projects. Rather, they see applications as products they are responsible for
    Decentralized Governance: Choosing the right tool according to the job is the goal. Developers can choose the best tools to solve their problems
    Agility: Microservices facilitate agile development. It is possible to create new features quickly and discard them again at any time.

#### 2. main components of microservices
    Some of the main components of microservices include: 
    Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration 
    IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception] 
    Cloud Infrastructure 
    API Gateway 
    Enterprise Service Bus 
    Service Delivery 

#### benifits and drawbacks 
    Benefits: 
    Self-contained, and independent deployment module. 
    Independently managed services.   
    In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.   
    It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.  
    A greater degree of scalability and agility.   
    Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.  
    Better communication between developers and business users.   
    Development teams of a smaller size.
    Drawbacks: 

    Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.  
    Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.   
    Pre-planning is essential.  
    Complex development.  
    Requires a cultural shift.  
    Expensive compared to monoliths.   
    Security implications. 
    Maintaining the network is more difficult.  

## 5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
    Load balancing is an important concept in microservices architecture as it helps to distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service, ensuring that each instance is utilized optimally and that the system can handle high levels of traffic. Load balancing can be done at several levels in the microservices stack, including the client-side load balancing and the server-side load balancing.

    Client-side load balancing involves the use of a load balancer component on the client side, which is responsible for distributing requests across multiple instances of a service. This approach is beneficial because it allows for the client to make informed routing decisions based on the available instances of the service.

    Server-side load balancing, on the other hand, involves the use of a load balancer component on the server side, which is responsible for distributing requests across multiple instances of a service. This approach is beneficial because it allows for more granular control over traffic routing and can be used in conjunction with other load balancing techniques such as traffic splitting and traffic shaping.

    Overall, load balancing is an essential technique for managing traffic in microservices architecture, and it requires careful consideration of the various factors involved, including the specific requirements of the system, the available tools and technologies, and the best practices for implementation and deployment.
