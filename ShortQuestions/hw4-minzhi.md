2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?

- Checked exception means the exception will be checked while compiling, ex> `FileNotFound`
- UncheckedException means the exception will be check during processing : `NullPointerException`

3. Can there be multiple finally blocks?

No

4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result?

Final result will be in finally block.

5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception? what is Compile/Checked Exception?

- Compile/Checked exception means the exception will be checked while compiling.
- Runtime/UncheckedException means the exception will be check during
  processing.

6. What is the difference between throw and throws?

The throws keyword is used to declare which exceptions can be thrown from a method, while the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code.

7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime exception before Exception?

Because Exception is larger than Null/Runtime exception. If we use small scape exception first we will know which part is wrong specific.

8. What is optional? why do you use it? write an optional example

```java
Employee optional =
        Optional.ofNullable(employee).orElse(new
        Employee(1, "CC", 23, 1992));
```

Optional is used to avoid Null checks and run time NullPointerExceptions

9. Why finally always be executed?

- finally will be executed whether or not the exception is handled.
- finally will still be executed if there is a return statement in the catch clause.

10. What is Java 8 new features?

- Default method and static method in interface
- Lambda & Functional Interface
- Method reference
- Stream API

11. What are the types of design patterns in Java?

Relationships Between Classes: `Inheritance`, `Composition`, `Aggregation`.

12. What are the SOLID Principles?

- Single Responsibility
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

13. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java?

- static volatile variable
- make constructor be private
- static synchronized getInstance method

14. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)?

Open for Extension, Closed for Modification.

15. Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be substituted with any object of type B

It means If a method is present in class A, It should also be present in class B so that the object of type B could substitute object of type.
